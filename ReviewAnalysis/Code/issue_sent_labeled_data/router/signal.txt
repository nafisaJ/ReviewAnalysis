With my Belkin pre-n I could go to the end of my driveway, which is over 300' before I  <i> lost signal <i> , in my house I always had full bars. [go, is, lost, had] [full]
When I replaced it with the dlink I could not get a signal in the far end of my house where the bedroom is, plus my iphone could not connect even on the deck! [replaced, get, is, connect] [far]
I eventually got a signal, but the speed was actuallly slower. [got, was] [slower]
And the most major problem is the  <i> poor signal <i> being received by my other pc on a wireless linksys card about 250 feet away from the router. [is, being, received] [major, poor, other, wireless]

I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty. [think, is, powered, are] [higher, faulty]
I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc. [developed, keep] [strong]

I was unencrypted and <i> dropping signal <i> every hour or so, but I was at least speedy. [was, dropping, was] [unencrypted, least, speedy]
I have not yet used the Linksys wireless notebook card, but the Microsoft wireless notebook card I have is giving "low" and "poor" signal strength readings 40 to 50 feet away indoors. [have, used, have, is, giving] [wireless, wireless, low, poor]
I will try raising the router higher and later, if I have to, I'll get a Linksys signal booster, but I shouldn't be having these problems at such short ranges. [try, raising, have, get, be, having] [higher, such, short]
It doesn't connect well with the 2WIRE, always <i> loses signal <i> , and I found its better to use the internet with out plugging in that useless junk. [does, connect, loses, found, use, plugging] [better, out, useless]
The thing is, it needs to sit in a "sweet spot" between your router and the receiving device so the router signal isn't too weak, and neither is the extender's. [is, needs, sit, receiving, is, is] [sweet, weak]
I realize the 5G <i> signal loses <i> strength quickly traveling through walls but that is excessive. [realize, loses, traveling, is] [excessive]
In that time, the router would randomly <i> drop the wireless signal <i> , ALOT. [drop] [wireless]

i bought this router hoping to get signal range improvement over my current belkin 54g router. [bought, hoping, get] [current, 54g]
Only pro's would be that when it worked it sent out the wireless signal a lot farther then some of the linksys routers that I have used. [be, worked, sent, have, used] [wireless]

If you're willing to spend the time to get it to work, it gives great signal! ['re, spend, get, work, gives] [willing, great]
I can't see the extender in my network, but I definitely went from a <i> poor signal <i> to an excellent signal, and I can see the blue lights start to blink on the extender when my Vista latop connects wirelessly. [see, went, see, start, blink, connects] [poor, excellent, blue]

I've used this product for about 5 months or so and was a bit disappointed with the signal strength of my computer connected to the adapter after the first hour of using it each time. ['ve, used, was, connected, using] [disappointed, first]
When you first plug in the adapter to the network, its signal strength is described as "excellent". [plug, is, described] [excellent]
After that such time, the signal would constantly cease to work, but then to kick back up to the  <i> "poor" signal <i>  strength every few minutes. [cease, work, kick] [such, poor, few]

The extender seems to TRY to boost weak signal, but garbage in is essentially garbage out, despite it saying 100%. [seems, TRY, boost, is, saying] [weak]
I will routinely have full wireless signal strength, but the router will lose it's internet connection. [have, lose, 's] [full, wireless]
It took a long time to set up and program properly with the base unit, it frequently <i> drops the signal <i> , and we have to reboot it. [took, set, drops, have, reboot] [long]
This replaced a Netgear BEFW11S4 router, which was hideously inept at keeping its wireless signal up or doing port-forwarding. [replaced, was, keeping, doing] [inept, wireless]
As I work, I can see the wireless <i> signal drop <i> from full strength to nothing for a few seconds, then come back. [work, see, come] [wireless, full, few]
At other times, I've turned on a computer to find the  <i> signal gone <i>  and unwilling to come back - this can be fixed by plugging into an ethernet port, visiting the configuration page and simply "OK"ing the wireless settings, without changing anything.

My first complaint is that the router comes with the signal strength at a default of 50%. [is, comes] [first]
Called technical support and was told that the signal could not go through the floor and a few walls. [Called, was, told, go] [technical, few]
As soon as I left the room, the <i> signal degraded <i> . [left] [degraded]

I generally got around 75% signal strength with that unit, whereas the WNDR3700 did achieve a signal strength into the room around 95% (it just did not get along with the dlink adapter). [got, did, achieve, did, get] [dlink]
The old MSN version with connected cellular signal produced a color coded road map that displayed (on 2D) all highway traffic conditions in the area of the map - over large areas if zoomed out and over more focused ares if you zoomed in. [produced, coded, displayed, zoomed, zoomed] [old, connected, cellular, large, focused]
The lifetime free traffic only works in larger cities (dependent on a relationship with a broadcast FM station to use a portion of their signal). [works, use] [free, larger, dependent]

, when WRE54G is on my network, it provides great signal in the room where it's installed, and it works at first, but after a time it fails to allow Windows to pull a valid IP address, resulting in no Internet access. [is, provides, 's, installed, works, fails, allow, pull, resulting] [great, valid]
I'm moving on to try the HGA7T instead - a fraction of the price of the WRE54G, much simpler solution that should be "good enough" and provide a stronger wireless signal that has better coverage than a single room (oh yeah, the WRE54G supposedly only boosts the signal significantly in the room in which it's installed, and the antenna should increase the signal broadly around the house). ['m, moving, try, be, provide, has, boosts, 's, installed, increase] [much, simpler, good, stronger, wireless, better, single]
This is important if you want to replace the antenna with a larger one or attach a signal booster. [is, want, replace, attach] [important, larger]

I was hoping this product would raise my poor signal I had downstairs. [was, hoping, raise, had] [poor]
And often I have the signal, but not the internet connection, and that's a problem of the router, because when installing again my old router, all these problems stops. [have, 's, installing, stops] [old]
I bought this router and I would get signal only about 25% of the time no matter how close I was to the base. [bought, get, signal, was] [close]
Their customer service people had no idea what to do and told me other people's router were crowding my signal (I live in New York City). [had, do, told, were, crowding, live] [other]
Not to mention that if highway traffic really IS bad enough that it should be avoided, by the time the FM signal gets picked up and the 1490t churns through the data, it's already too late. [mention, IS, be, avoided, gets, picked, 's] [bad, 1490t, late]
My Porsche is fast but faster than a gps signal, I don't think so. [is, do, think] [faster]

I declared no firmware changed, nothing was changed, but <i> dropped signal <i> strength in a sudden. [declared, changed, was, changed, dropped] [sudden]
I tried to upgraded and downgrade a few firmware, nothing improve to the signal strength. [tried, upgraded, improve] [few]
How annoying when at the same time, my next door neighbor's Linksys router is sending a nice clear consistent signal. [annoying, is, sending] [same, next, nice, clear, consistent]
What's worse, it doesn't like someone trying to connect directly to the Expander itself; remember, it's nothing more than an access point at its core, so it should still be broadcasting a local signal which should do a private IP; it does, then shuts down and refuses connections. ['s, does, trying, connect, remember, 's, be, broadcasting, do, does, shuts, refuses] [worse, more, local, private]
My environment is not electrically noisy, either - this thing just doesn't have the power to do anything but short line of sight transmission, and connections die while the status monitor still reports signal strength as "very good". [is, does, have, do, die, reports] [noisy, short, good]
Works pretty good until you or your neighbor get that microwave oven going, then signal's gone even if the router is within 10 feet from you. [get, going, gone, is] [good]
Works well, sometimes there are some issues with the signal probably because there are a lot of wireless router on the same building. [are, are] [wireless, same]

When I first used it and kept <i> losing signal <i> I blamed it on fog but then on a clear sunny day with no high buildings or trees in the vicinity, I lost signal 9 times in 7 miles. [used, kept, losing, blamed, lost] [clear, sunny, high]
Oh, and by the way, the main reason I got this product was to see if it would have better range and signal strength than my Linksys WRT54GS. [got, was, see, have] [main, better]
The <i> signal drops <i> off with great regularity. [drops] [great]
All the lights indicate it is still working fine, and my hard wire connection to the cable modem works great, but no signal emits from the wireless router. [indicate, is, working, works, emits] [hard, great, wireless]

Linksys knows this and has corrected the same problem with early models of its wireless routers (I use one and the Mac sees and can use it, but with an extremely low signal, thus the need for an expander. [knows, has, corrected, use, sees, use] [same, early, wireless, low]
This model of the Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router disconnects the internet signal whenever the digital phone is in use. [disconnects, is] [digital]
The bottom line was that using any other combination of computers, routers, adapters, and positioning of the devices resulted in our typical 1-2 bar signal strength with a positive internet connection. [was, using, resulted] [bottom, other, typical, 1-2, positive]
Both the one at my home office and the one at our business office have done the same thing -- simply stopped being able to connect to the internet after a couple of months even though the signal strength was great -- and they only worked for a few days after the firmware download that the tech support people walk you through (or that you can do for yourself).

I'm in a lab, with perfect Ethernet connections on both the WAN and LAN sides of this router (no ISP involved), and my wirelessly connected computer is sitting feet from the thing, so there's no "bad signal" issues. ['m, involved, connected, is, sitting, 's] [perfect, bad]
4 GHz channel and this band has only 3 non overlapping channels - 1,6, & 11; 5 GHz signal is reduced more when passing through walls etc. [has, overlapping, is, reduced, passing] [more]
But low range of 5 GHz signal through walls and physical obstacles limits the real world utility of this router. [limits] [low, physical, real]
Unless you are going to use the 5 GHz signal within 15 feet, you do not really need it and can save money by buying single band regular 802. [are, going, use, do, need, save, buying] [single, regular]
It gives me the strongest signal and easier to config the router when compare to Belkin and SBC 1(gave that away so can't remember the brand). [gives, config, compare, gave, remember] [strongest, easier]
Once in awhile probably due the heat, the wireless  <i> signal dissapear <i> , or wouldn't let wireless comps log in and I have to pwr it down for 10 secs and pwr back on and it worked again. [let, log, have, pwr, worked] [due, wireless, wireless]

After buying two (2) of the WGR614's (recommended by Netgear)and spending countless hours on hold with Technical Support(India), this Router could  <i> never hold a signal <i>  and every few hours to every few days needed to be re-set. [buying, recommended, spending, hold, needed, be] [countless, few, few, re-set]
Set-up was very easy on the Netgear, but having to buy 2 units and both not working, I changed to the Linksys WRT54G and never have had a dropped signal yet. [was, having, buy, working, changed, have, had, dropped] [easy]

You can buy a WAP54G from Linksys for less money, get much better signal strength, and get the same functionality. [buy, get, get] [less, better, same]
I noticed couple of times the wireless <i> signal has been down <i> but then in a few seconds, my wireless laptop reconnects. [noticed, has, been] [wireless, few, wireless]
I'd be using my wireless laptop and all of a sudden, the laptop would show that the <i> signal was gone <i>. [be, using, show, was, gone] [wireless, sudden]
So, now I have everything wired back up to my ATT DSL router (2Wire) where I do not have the regular loss of signal. [have, wired, do, have] [2Wire, regular]
After an hour or 2 of attempting to get this to link my to my brother's weak wireless signal (100+ ft. [attempting, get, link] [weak, wireless]
The <i> signal bars were fluctuating <i>, as if there was something wrong with the transmitter. [get, were, was] [mere, dry, fluctuating, wrong]

The <i> signal strength is very weak <i>. [is] [weak]
My brand new computer gets a 1 or 2 out of 5 bar signal (about 5 to 30 Mbit/s) to this router when it is about 40 feet away. [gets, is] [new]
However, I can always get a 4 bar signal from my neighbors' routers on either side of me, and I know at least one of them also has a Linksys. [get, know, has] [least]
<p>Btw: We checked wether the external radiolink could <i> interfer with the signal <i>. [checked, interfer] [external]
It stopped working and started making a weird high pitched sound, due to my Time Warner cable which <i> resets it's signal <i> every 6-12 months. [stopped, working, started, making, resets, 's] [few, weird, high, pitched, due]
For some positives, it acquires signal very quickly and the 5 inch display is clean and clear. [acquires, is] [clean, clear]
If the signal does stay up for any length of time, it will be cut off by nearby cell phone, cordless phones, microwave ovens etc. [does, stay, be, cut] [nearby, cordless]

I'm hoping that technology has progressed to the point that I can count on a wireless router that continues putting out a signal for more than a day. ['m, hoping, has, progressed, count, continues, putting] [wireless, more]
The only upside is that the WRE54G appears, by inspection, to at least be extending my wireless network's range into areas of my house that <i> had very weak signal <i> strength previously. [is, appears, be, extending, had] [only, least, wireless, weak]
Problem is that I still <i> get marginal signal <i> sitting only 2 feet away from the router and it still drops connection every half hour and I have to spend a lot of time getting back to work. [is, get, sitting, drops, have, spend, getting, work] [marginal]

If I got further than 30 feet from the router and had any obstructions, the <i> signal was just about useless <i>. [got, had, was] [useless]
This does expand the range of the wireless signal but not as much as I would like. [does, expand, like] [wireless, much]
I dont know if there are legal <i> restrictions on signal power <i> but it seemes that current technology should allow further range for a signal expander. [dont, know, are, seemes, allow] [legal, current, further]
The wireless connection worked okay, but I <i> could never get more than 35% signal <i> (40 feet, 2 walls between). [worked, get] [wireless, okay, more]

I was routed to a road which took me on an 18 mile trek through heavily congested business districts with many, many traffic signal and many, many trucks cars etc. [was, routed, took] [congested, many, many, many, many]
Instead of the route my old Nuvii 250 always suggested, (also Google suggested) which was US 87 to NY 7 to US 787 the to I-90 the 1450LMT directed me to NY route 9 which is 6 minutes longer (per Google) and a route which took us through business and residential areas with numerous traffic signal etc. [suggested, suggested, was, directed, is, took] [old, residential, numerous]
