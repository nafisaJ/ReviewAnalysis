I have Comcast as an ISP using a Motorola SB3100D cable modem, meaning the modem utilizes the cable for incoming transmission and a dialed Telco connection for outgoing transmission. [have, using, meaning, utilizes] [incoming, dialed, outgoing]
The PC hardwired to the router worked fine, but if the remote PC wants to access the internet, the hardwired PC must establish the internet session (dial the Telco return connection) before the remote PC is able to access the internet. [hardwired, worked, wants, access, establish, dial, is, access] [fine, remote, hardwired, remote, able]
Sometimes only the WAN (connection from router-(modem)-world) drops, most of the time the LAN drops too- both from my laptop (wireless) as well as from my PC (ethernet). [drops, drops] [most, wireless]
Can't release/renew IP, not even disable/enable NIC - to fix it you have to reboot the router (AND sometimes disable/enable NIC to get connection back! [release\, fix, have, reboot, get] [disable\, disable\]
Now the ethernet <i> connection drops for no apparent reason <i>. [drops] [apparent]
The device will cut in half whatever bandwidth will detect, so the farer you position it from your access point the slower the connection will be when going through the expander. [cut, detect, position, be, going] [slower]
I had to play with the location to improve the internal reception, but even after moving the unit to an external area in a window facing the outbuilding, I receive only faint sporadic connection. [had, play, improve, moving, facing, receive] [internal, external, faint, sporadic]

Pros: Works as described, increases wireless network range and speed Works with secured networks Compatible with Linksys routers Three year manufacturer's warranty Cons: Automatic setup doesn't work as promised (even on unsecured networks) Expander is prone to resetting or changing configuration settings if unplugged or power outage occurs Breaks frequently (in my experience), unit can heat up quite a bit during normal use Blue/Red status indicator lights do not always reflect actual expander status (ie 2 blue lights indicating connection, but connection is not present) Overall, when the products works, it works great.

I googled this item and learned it has a history of drops and many sites discussed a fix of zero-ing out a default five-second setting to keep the connection alive. [googled, learned, has, discussed, zero-ing, setting, keep] [many, five-second, alive]
The only problem is,, that setting only works if your ISP requires you to login to your connection. [is, setting, works, requires, login] [only]
I don't know about other ISPs or countries but in the US, neither Comcast nor AT&T require you to login to your broadband connection -- it's "always on" which is one of the benefits of broadband. [do, know, require, login, 's, is] [other]

Somehow, as the connection goes through the cable modem to the router and then to my laptop's wireless card, the speed is reduced to dialup sometimes. [goes, is, reduced, dialup] [wireless]
Anyway, I finally gave up, only to find months later that there is indeed a problem with this router's firmware (related to DNS name resolution, which causes an intermittent but consistently occurring disconnection on the WAN port). [gave, find, is, related, causes, occurring] [intermittent]

You can speed it up by moving the expander closer to the router/AP, it will then expand the connection speed available from THAT new location but this then decreases your overall range. [speed, moving, expand, decreases] [available, new, overall]
In addition, it frequently <i> dropped the wireless connection <i>. [dropped, wired, remained] [wireless, good]
The wireless connection could only be restored by rebooting the router. [be, restored, rebooting] [wireless]
I cannot tell you the amount of time we wasted rebooting puters, rebooting cable modem, and redoing all the connection to make sure it wasn't a problem on our end. [tell, wasted, rebooting, rebooting, redoing, make, was] [sure]
It immediately recognized my ethernet connection and I was soon set up and running 130mbps at 5' from the router and 270mbps down on the first floor kitchen table. [recognized, was, set, running] [first]

It didn't take that long on my computer as I have a fiber connection in the house. [did, take, have] [long]
I originally bought this router in 2003 with plans to set up a wireless network in my home where three computers were operating on 3 different connection - two unique broadband links (Cable, DSL) and one on a 56K modem. [bought, set, were, operating] [wireless, different, unique, 56K]
A year later I did finally figure out the router enough to get things operational so that others could share the cable broadband connection in my household. [did, get, share] [operational]
Helped a lot with the wired connection (Have a NAS drive with photos and Videos)   -- Didn't test the throughput of the wireless bands but didn't see anything slow down when they were working  THE BAD   -- The data monitor built into the device is pretty useless.

Once the router is working for the wired connection, it nevers works for a wireless status. [is, working, wired, nevers] [wireless]
It's a breeze to set-up, and it may work fine for weeks or a few months, but then something happens and it results in either extremely slow internet speeds or no connection at all. ['s, set-up, work, happens, results] [few, slow]
Even though I was able to connect to the linksys web site, the setup wizard kept <i> failing to detect a network connection <i> (not a good start). [was, connect, kept, failing, detect] [able, good]

However, once the device was setup, it would work for maybe 3 or 4 minutes and then it would kick me off the internet (while still maintaining what it called an "excellent" connection to the router). [was, work, kick, maintaining, called] [excellent]
This router throttles my 20 megabit per second (Mb/S) cable modem connection significantly, and it gets worse over time until it is unusable. [throttles, gets, is] [second, worse, unusable]
Could not even get it to work with WIRED connection. [get, work] [WIRED]
After a year with the Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster (that created an immense amount of frustration and anger due to constant disconnection to the internet), I went ahead and purchased this router after doing my research. [created, went, purchased, doing] [immense, due, constant]
Most importantly, in my bedroom I always have a connection, whereas before with my Linksys router I was finding it less and less common to be connected there. [have, was, finding, be, connected] [Most, common]

11n wireless The slower speed of the *old* DSL router is not relevant since it only serves as a broadboand router for DSL, and you don't need a Gigabit connection to the Internet anyway. [is, serves, do, need] [11n, wireless, slower, old, relevant]
If you're a gamer, or you use your computer on the net and need a constant connection, this router is not for you. ['re, use, need, is] [constant]

I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running. [have, seen, offering, upgrading, does, have, be, get, running] [many, hard, wireless]

I'll need to set up a connection in another room in a few months so will deal with it then, hopefully in less time than I messed around with it this time. [need, set, deal, messed] [few, less]
Next day, we bought a Netgear RP614 router, and after an initial call to tech support to work out an issue with the router talking to our kind of cable modem (a "telco" or 2 way modem, which needs a cable connection for the downstream, and a phone line dail-up connection to complete the upstream), we were up and running smoothly, and have had no more troubles with the network since then. [bought, tech, work, talking, needs, complete, were, running, have, had] [Next, initial, downstream, dail-up, upstream, more]
Fair wireless connection throughout the house (though the "through-the-walls" range is NOT what is what Link-Sys purports it to be). [is, is, purports, be] [wireless]

I can't quote him directly per the disclaimer in his e-mail, but to paraphrase he basically said we were lucky the router kept a connection at all with multiple computers accessing the WAN at the same time! [quote, paraphrase, said, were, kept, accessing] [lucky, multiple, same]
He also told me to adjust my MTU value, giving me about 5 values to try, saying to try each one until my connection was more stable. [told, adjust, giving, try, saying, try, was] [stable]
