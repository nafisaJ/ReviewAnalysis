The only firmware that [U][B]EVER[/B][/U] worked right on this router is the stock 31 firmware. [worked, is] [only]
If you are a consumer and want this router to function as it should, do not bother with any firmware other than [B]1. [are, want, function, do, bother] [other]
The entire staff of Netgear firmware engineers should be fired. [be, fired] [entire]
<p>Some people have mentioned similar problems that went away after a firmware upgrade. [have, mentioned, went] [similar, firmware]
Once the problem started showing up, I upgraded to the latest firmware. [started, showing, upgraded] [latest]
I had purchased the add on antennas to extend my range and had even experimented with third party firmware. [had, purchased, add, extend, had, experimented] [third]
Also, the hardware has gotten cheaper and apparently I couldn't run third party firmware on it. [has, gotten, run] [cheaper, third]
I have used this product for almost a year and I have spent way too many hours trying to make the firmware work with my Apple systems. [have, used, have, spent, trying, make] [many]
It seems to be related to the firmware version, but the older version which didn't appear to have any issues can no longer be loaded into the router. [seems, be, related, did, appear, have, be, loaded] [older]
Also, you will not be able to use third party firmware with this version of the router. [be, use] [able, third]
Don't forget to start by updating the firmware, because if you set everything up first then update the firmware, you will need to repeat the setup process since this firmware update restores everything back to the factory settings. [Do, forget, start, updating, set, update, need, repeat, update, restores] [first, firmware]
After much messing around with it -- searching the web for lessons learned -- upgrading firmware on my Linksys WAP -- I did manage to get it working without the WEP turned on. [messing, searching, learned, upgrading, did, manage, get, working, turned] [much]
6 months after the release of Windows XP, Linksys is yet to release a firmware update to address Windows XP UPnP issues. [is, release, update, address] [firmware]
Even Netgear support rep agreed that there is a  <i> bug in the firmware <i>  which makes the router drop connection with the internet (wired and wireless). [agreed, is, makes, wired] [Netgear, wireless]
Because I upgraded to the G rougter from the slower B router a week ago and of course the first thing I did was to visit the Linksys website and download the most current firmware for my new router (3 point something). [upgraded, did, was, visit] [slower, first, current, new]
I thought I was doing the prudent thing but little did I know that Linksys would sell me a supposedly compatible product that would not run with anything but a specific, not to mention somewhat older version of the router's firmware. [thought, was, doing, did, know, sell, run, mention] [prudent, little, compatible, specific, older]
I explained I was having problems with my WRE54G working with my WRT54G adding that I had been told by several people that I had the <i> wrong firmware <i> on the router. [explained, was, having, working, adding, had, been, told, had] [several, wrong]
The tech asked what firmware version I had and I told him whatever the most recent version was on their webste, 3 point something. [asked, had, told, was] [recent]
I again told him that several people had reported problems by using any version of firmware other than 2. [told, had, reported, using] [several, other]
2 and that once they found a way to downgrade to that exact firmware version the expander worked fine. [found, worked] [exact]
02 firmware level, but this WRE54G does NOT support WPA encryption, which the WRT54G does. [does, does] [firmware]
I will say that I haven't upgraded to the current firmware yet but give me a break. [say, have, upgraded, give] [current]
should somone have to upgrade the firmware on a device into version 4 just to get the stupid thing to stay connected to the Internet, keep from stalling every 30 seconds into a download, dropping tons of packets, timing out every minute on streaming audio, etc, etc, etc? [somone, have, upgrade, get, stay, connected, keep, stalling, dropping, timing, streaming] [stupid]
This was with the latest Linksys firmware update. [was, update] [latest]
I upgraded the firmware, tried different cables, moving it to another location, everything, and nothing worked. [upgraded, tried, moving, worked] [different]
I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running. [have, seen, offering, upgrading, does, have, be, get, running] [many, hard, wireless]
It has a lot of problems, and there are still  <i> no firmware <i>  updates available as of mid-April. [has, are] [available]
<p>UPDATE: Linksys released updated firmware a month later, which fixed most of the router's stability problems. [released, updated, fixed] [<p>, most]
I checked out their website, and there are firmware files for 1. [checked, are] [firmware]
<p>Overall, I will say that the product does work as expected, once you update the firmware to the latest version. [say, does, work, expected, update] [latest]
This model has less memory than the previous models and its  <i> firmware can NOT be easily changed <i>  to one based in linux. [has, be, changed, based] [less, previous]
If you want to change the firmware you are better off buying the WRT54GL. [want, change, are, buying] [better]
When I upgraded the firmware to the latest version, the router started dropping wireless connections, rebooting randomly, etc. [upgraded, started, dropping, rebooting] [latest, wireless]
DLink doesn't allow you to go back to the previous firmware version either. [does, allow, go] [previous]
Maybe, given enough time, they will come out with a firmware that makes this thing work, but I got tired of waiting. [given, come, makes, got, tired, waiting] [enough]
The agent also told me to never update firmware through GUI because that could "destabilize" the device :-) They do provide RMA (after extensive phone troubleshooting), but you'd have to pay $30 in case you'd like a replacement device being delivered the next day. [told, update, destabilize, do, provide, have, pay, like, being, delivered] [extensive, next]
Because of the initial set-up issues, I am afraid to perform any maintenance as a firmware upgrade, enable other features, etc. [am, perform, enable] [initial, set-up, afraid, firmware, other]
DLink support told me not to upgrade firmware unless I have real problems. [told, upgrade, have] [DLink, firmware, real]
Pros: Large Screen Easy input of addresses Connectivity for upgrading system and maps Fairly quick download times (30 minutes for both the firmware and map) Cons: Touch screen is buggy Glare on the LCD Clunky interface Poor routing capability Inaccurate listing of some addresses. [upgrading, is, routing] [Large, quick, buggy]
I even looked for a firmware update their was none available. [looked, update, was] [firmware, available]
D-Link technical support could not fix, either through firmware update, configuration changes or with a replacement router. [fix, update] [D-Link, technical]
Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. [upgrading, drops] [latest]
2 of the technicians told me to upgrade the firmware (which was already upgraded) and to reset, so many times, that I got extroadinarily frustraqted and asked to talk to a manager. [told, upgrade, was, upgraded, reset, got, frustraqted, asked, talk] [many]
04 of the firmware loaded, I could manually input the device MAC address into a field provided and the device worked fine with WEP encryption. [loaded, provided, worked] [fine]
And yes, I was using latest firmware bit the bullet and ran wire directly to the room with the week signal and do not regret the effort. [was, using, ran, do, regret] [latest, firmware]
There are many supposed after market firmwares for this router, but none of them work on Version 6. [are, supposed, work] [many]
3) I upgraded to the latest firmware as of Nov 2008, still tons of issues, it works after I reboot cleanly for 5 mins or so, then wireless connections keep falling very frequently especially if I'm using more than 1 wireless or wired connection, also my PS3 and Vonage were not performing as well as before. [upgraded, works, reboot, keep, falling, 'm, using, wired, were, performing] [latest, wireless, more, wireless]
I have updated it to the latest firmware using the Garmin Updater tool and still it has problems. [have, updated, using, has] [latest]
Luckily, my girlfriend who is rather computer literate ( I am semi)  bought one of these units a few weeks ago and was able to guide me through the quirky set up using the web site to update the firmware and the maps. [is, am, bought, was, guide, set, using, update] [few, able, quirky]
Have the same <i> firmware problem <i> with the V1. [Have] [same]
So I upgraded the firmware to the newest v1. [upgraded] [newest]
After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. [upgrading, firmware, setting, works] [few, e-mailing]
Linksys is supposed to support PPPoE beginning with firmware version 1. [is, supposed, support, beginning] [firmware]
<p>The current firmware version is 1. [is] [<p>, current]
While I applaud Linksys updating their firmware frequently I was not happy waiting for the PPPoE support to be fixed and already returned the unit. [applaud, updating, was, waiting, be, fixed, returned] [happy]
The problem has gotten worse - I have installed the latest firmware for this router - still loses its signal every five to ten minutes. [has, gotten, have, installed, loses, ten] [worse, latest]
After 5 HOURS on the phone with 4 different "tech support" experts, they had me upgrading firmware, then downgrading firmware, and finally running my cable from the modem thru a 10base-t hub. [had, upgrading, downgrading, running] [different, tech, 10base-t]
Interestingly enough I have had 2 "firmware" upgrades that the router identified that it needed within this period of time, which I think is odd. [have, had, identified, needed, think, is] [odd]
I downloaded the new firmware at least 3 times. [downloaded] [new, least]
I decided to try the latest firmware (1. [decided, try] [latest]
I went back to the older firmware (1. [went] [older]
Even after upgrading to the latest  <i> firmware, these problems have persisted <i> , and I suspect there are serious bugs in NATing any kind of UDP traffic (games, VoIP, etc). [upgrading, have, persisted, suspect, are, NATing] [latest, serious]
I used the built-in utility to check the firmware and it told me that I already had the latest. [used, check, told, had] [built-in, latest]
In a final attempt to get the thing to work, I updated the firmware to version 1. [get, work, updated] [final]
20  <i> firmware had been pulled <i>  and was no longer available. [had, been, pulled, was] [available]
1) I bought this product for the SecureSpot feature and found out only after a very long, frustrating discussion with a less-than willing Customer Help Desk that SecureSpot is not yet available on the Rev B Hardware, and DLink has no idea when it will be added to the firmware. [bought, found, frustrating, Help, is, has, be, added] [less-than, willing, available]
Before this, I owned a Netgear router that was working great, until I bought new vista computers, and Netgear decided not to upgrade their firmware to be vista-compliant. [owned, was, working, bought, decided, upgrade, be] [great, new, vista-compliant]
) Went online and searched, recent WRT54G  <i> firmwares had a bug <i>  with DHCP. [Went, searched, had] [recent]
The sad but fated conclusion: A new firmware promised to fix the bug, so I thought I'd be a power user and download it. [fated, promised, fix, thought, be] [sad, new]
Note to Linksys: if your firmware download page has seven or more downloads specifically for the WRT54G, you should give the end-user an obvious link telling them how to determine which WRT54G to use. [Note, has, give, telling, determine, use] [more, obvious]
I submitted the firmware up to the router, and it went to a blank page that said, "Don't interrupt this. [submitted, went, said, Do, interrupt] [blank]
After 15 minutes, the page hadn't auto-refreshed, so I opened another tab and logged in, and the router was chugging along with the old firmware. [had, opened, logged, was, chugging] [auto-refreshed, old]
Well, I won't invite armchairing by further details, except to state that the router briefly reported itself as running the new firmware, but still wouldn't DHCP my wireless devices, then wouldn't DHCP my wired device, and finally wouldn't respond at all (brick had been achieved). [invite, armchairing, reported, running, DHCP, DHCP, wired, respond, had, been, achieved] [further, new, wireless]
I reset it rolled back  <i> firmware it would not work <i>  and stay up when I needed it. [reset, rolled, work, stay, needed] [firmware]
The firmware is the latest version, tried cycling power several times with no luck. [is, tried, cycling] [latest, several]
I tried upgrading the firmware, playing with the frequencies, the speeds, disabling the 5GHz options, and it continued. [tried, upgrading, playing, disabling, continued] [5GHz]
I have downloaded the firmware and upgraded it; actually replaced it since my device shipped with the most current version supposedly already loaded. [have, downloaded, upgraded, replaced, shipped, loaded] [current]
After firmware upgrade it works well for normal router and WAP functions. [works] [firmware, normal]
after 3 hours, i was told, to bring unit back and try to find a version 4 of the router, that they  <i> didnt have a 'stable' firmware <i>  yet. [was, told, bring, try, find, didnt, have] [stable]
I would definitly avoid this unti untill a few firmware updates are out. [avoid, are] [unti, few, firmware]
I then followed the instructions on the two top-rated posts (basically disabling security, downloading and upgrading firmware, then re-enabling security). [followed, disabling, downloading, upgrading, re-enabling] [top-rated]
So here's what I suggest: #1  Make sure you have downloaded the latest firmware for your router and the range expander. [suggest, have, downloaded] [sure, latest]
Then suddenly for no reason ever 10 seconds i would lose connectivity ,  I tried everything I reset, updated the firmware installed some hacked firmware. [lose, tried, reset, updated, installed, hacked] [firmware]
--The Setup CD is worthless --There is no useful documentation provided with the unit nor on the Web site --The  <i> out-of-date firmware <i>  with which the unit is supplied makes it unusable (I could not get a link from two inches away until I updated the firmware). [is, is, provided, is, supplied, makes, get, updated] [worthless, useful, out-of-date, unusable]
After a few hours the NetGear WNDR3700 went offline, amber light, and through various attempts cannot connect wirelessly, via cable, update firmware or even reset default factory settings to troubleshoot issues with the router. [went, connect, update, reset, troubleshoot] [few, offline, amber, various]
The hardware is worse than version 2, which was good because it allowed installation of custom firmware. [is, was, allowed] [worse, good]
Now it is impossible, you have to stay with the company's firmware, which is plainly bad. [is, have, stay, is] [impossible, bad]
33 or higher firmware, it makes it lots easier. [makes] [higher, easier]
He sent me advice, firmware updates, and we emailed repeatedly and found solutions to the problems. [sent, emailed, found] [firmware]
I isolated it to the USB storage, a bug that was supposedly fixed in the latest firmware but was apparently not fixed. [isolated, was, fixed, was, fixed] [latest]
D-Link is no longer supporting this product with firmware updates, so based on the above mentioned issues and the lack of future firmware updates to fix some obvious bugs, I can't recommend this product. [is, supporting, based, mentioned, fix, recommend] [firmware, above, future, obvious]
I should mention that the live webcams that this device refused to properly forward ports for, work perfectly with the 4500 using the identical port forwarding settings, so when I say that there is a  <i> BUG in this devices firmware <i>  regarding port forwarding, I know what I am talking about. [mention, refused, using, say, is, firmware, regarding, know, am, talking] [live, identical, port]
It might be a hardware problem and it cannot be fixed by firmware upgrade. [be, be, fixed] [firmware]
After contacting COX they said I may need to upgrade Firmware on Netgear router, so I downloaded the latest firmware and upgraded router. [contacting, said, need, upgrade, downloaded, upgraded] [latest]
The  <i> firmware on this router is just terrible <i> . [is] [terrible]
Installation was easy, firmware had to be upgraded to the latest one (laptop refused to connect without that). [was, had, be, upgraded, refused, connect] [easy, latest]
I couldn't  connect to it from my PC to upgrade the firmware because it was stuck in  self-test mode. [connect, upgrade, was, stuck] [self-test]
Yes, I updated the firmware, first day installed. [updated, installed] [first]
(Why doesn't this come with the most recent firmware? [does, come] [recent]
Anyway, he gave up after 30 minutes, and said I'd have to upload new firmware to the router. [gave, said, have, upload] [new]
I tried downloading and installing new firmware, and the router wouldn't except any update. [tried, downloading, installing, except, update] [new]
would you believe that their tech rep said he would email me the firmware update, eventhough I couldn't access email (that was why I was calling him). [believe, said, email, update, access, was, was, calling] [eventhough]
So I went to netgear's website to download the latest firmware. [went, download] [latest]
With the firmware image ready, my next task was to get the Netgear device back up and running so I could access its setup page. [was, get, running, access] [ready, next]
Anyway, I got the thing to boot, and loaded the new firmware image on it, then restarted the router. [got, loaded, restarted] [new]
On the failure page that results, you can find a link that takes you to the "basic settings" section, which is essentially the menu system the old firmware used to set up the router. [results, find, takes, is, used, set] [basic, old]
Like I said, though, I planned to replace the stock Netgear firmware with DD-WRT to get those advanced features. [said, planned, replace, get] [advanced]
Don't consider this router, though, if you want to run an alternate firmware or are looking for a router with more advanced features. [Do, consider, want, run, are, looking] [alternate, more, advanced]
However the firmware upgrades from d-link made the router less and less favorable -- they're buggy and hard to get everything set up correctly. [made, 're, get, set] [d-link, favorable, buggy, hard]
The worst -- the latest firmware upgrade bricked my router and the built-in emergency backup system failed to bring the router back to life! [bricked, failed, bring] [worst, latest, built-in]
<p>The professional technician who installed the router and network card spent about 5 hours trying to tweak it, including downloading updated firmware from Linksys, but to no avail. [installed, spent, trying, tweak, including, downloading, updated] [<p>, professional]
However, I have to take 2 stars off for lack of stability, ESPECIALLY with recent firmware upgrades. [have, take] [recent]
Some versions of the firmware don't play World of Warcraft - miscalculates the checksum for a particular packet, leading to the game being a 'ghost town'. [do, play, miscalculates, leading, being] [particular]
First thing I did was updating the firmware. [did, was, updating] [First]
I was very pleased that the newest version of the firmware includes WPA. [was, includes] [pleased, newest]
I was hoping the newest firmware would fix the problem but it didn't. [was, hoping, fix, did] [newest]
When I chatted with the Linksys support, he claimed there were only firmware differences. [chatted, claimed, were] [firmware]
<p>Most recent firmware you say? [say] [Most, recent]
Other folks suggested a new beta version of the firmware, but it still has lockup issues too. [suggested, has] [Other, new, beta]
But unless you like unplugging your router twice a day to get it unstuck, avoid it until they <i> fix the firmware <i> . [unplugging, get, avoid, fix] [unstuck]
I'm a computer engineer by training and tried everything I could think of - changing the the channels (one by one), updating the firmware to v10, hardware reset, playing with the preamble and tuning other parameters - all to no avail. ['m, tried, think, changing, updating, v10, playing, tuning] [other]
<p>I've tried a half dozen different versions of Linksys' firmware versions. ['ve, tried] [different, firmware]
I've upgraded the firmware, but that only established the connection until the next day when it failed again. ['ve, upgraded, established, failed] [next]
If you have the WRT54G router, go to Linksys and download the latest version of the firmware. [have, go, download] [latest]
I've seen 2 firmware updates, but neither made any apparent improvement in stability or features. ['ve, seen, made] [apparent]
Apparently the hardware is good but the setup software, firmware and tech support are abysmal. [is, are] [good, abysmal]
I'm guessing that this problem can be resolved via a future firmware update from Linksys, but who knows when that is coming. ['m, guessing, be, resolved, update, knows, is, coming] [future]
Linksys must perform little or no quality review of their firmware. [perform] [little]
The signal strength problem that lead to my purchase was due to a bug in my WRT54g's firmware (2. [lead, was] [due]
Again, Linksys demonstrates an amazing inability to properly <i> test their firmware <i> . [demonstrates, test] [amazing]
4 firmware, I am currently running at between about 36% and 52% signal strength, which provides a minimum of 36 mbps, higher than the maximum 27 mbps (54/2) that the WRE54g can deliver. [am, running, provides, deliver] [higher]
If that does not work, and you do not have a Linksys wga54g game adapter (or you are patient and trusting enough to wait for Linksys to correct the <i> problem in a firmware <i> update, or you are feeling lucky), and you have a Linksys router that the WRE54g is advertised as compatible with, purchase the WRE54g. [does, work, do, have, are, trusting, wait, correct, update, are, feeling, have, is, advertised, purchase] [patient, firmware, lucky, compatible]
I guess the setup CD makes a great frisbee - it certainly does not help with setup, as it couldn't detect the WRE54g, even with WEP and MAC filtering off, and broadcast SSID on, and using a wrt54g router having the latest firmware downloaded from Linksys (2. [guess, makes, does, help, detect, filtering, using, having, downloaded] [great, wrt54g, latest]
I checked the website and noted the existence of new firmware. [checked, noted] [new]
The new firmware's date was 6/8/04. [was] [new]

Too bad the link on Linksys's website resulted in the download of yet another useless version of the WRE54g setup utility, no firmware included. [resulted, included] [bad, website, useless]
Here's what Wikipedia has to say about this device: "Known issues As shipped, the Linksys firmware crashes under heavy peer-to-peer network traffic, such as BitTorrent. ['s, has, say, Known, shipped] [heavy, peer-to-peer, such]
Briefly, it involves installing a 3rd party firmware. [involves, installing] [3rd]
And there's not enough memory in this thing to install a full version of DD-WRT (3rd party firmware) so you're essentially SOL. ['s, install, 're] [enough, full, 3rd]
After about 10 failed attempts, I managed to flash it to newer firmware. [failed, managed, flash] [newer]

VXWorks Junk, September 8, 2006 Reviewer: Bryan Garrett "skunkwerx" - See all my reviews Do NOT purchase this unit thinking you will be able to upgrade the firmware. [See, Do, purchase, thinking, be, upgrade] [able]
This is NOTHING like the old versions of the WRT54G and GS routers that would allow opensource firmware with lots of flexibility. [is, allow] [old]
This is the "new" version has 1/4th the memory and very <i> buggy firmware <i> that is NOT upgradable to customized versions. [is, has, is, customized] [new, buggy, upgradable]
The first tech thought I needed to upgrade the firmware and told me where to download and to call back if I needed more help. [thought, needed, upgrade, told, call, needed] [first, more]
240 (user blank and password admin) in my web browser and connect to the expander where I could install the new firmware. [connect, install] [new]
It took me a bit to work out what was going on because I initially left the neigbours IP settings in manual (which is fine when intalling the firmware) but after using the setup disk you need to go back to automatic! [took, work, was, going, left, is, intalling, using, need, go] [fine, automatic]
The firmware which came out on the 29th January does not help resolve the problem, although they claimed that it will solve some compatibility issues with CISCO chipsets, etc. [came, does, help, resolve, claimed, solve] [29th]
Nor would it accept a firmware upgrade (this was a V4 running the 1. [accept, was, running] [firmware, V4]
but would not come close to saying they had bad hardware or firmware. [come, saying, had] [bad]
Perhaps it is just the recent Hardware version 4 and the firmware. [is] [recent]
Also, contact Linksys to get the latest firmware to update the extender -- the updated one supports security better. [get, update, updated, supports] [latest]
I am also having great difficulty trying to install a third party firmware on the router. [am, having, trying, install] [great, third]
I was hoping that it might not be a hardware issue and it might be a  <i> firmware issue <i> . [was, hoping, be, be] [firmware]
This router was a gift; I have set it up with the factory firmware and no one complained about the WiFi a signal dropping, or slow connection speed. [was, have, set, complained, dropping] [slow]
Also, the features don't come close to the terrific Trendnet firmware -- for example, port forwarding only allows you to forward the same port on the WAN side as LAN side (I usually forward port 222 to port 22 on one machine and 223 to 22 on another). [do, come, allows] [terrific, port, same, port, port]
I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware, but this did not solve the problem. [called, helped, install, did, solve] [tech, new]
<p>I ended up performing a firmware upgrade and re-configuring the router. [ended, performing, re-configuring] [firmware]
No change, nothing worked (I had DL the latest firmware upgrade for the V5 hardware (1. [worked, had] [latest]
After all this time, the tech tells me that the hardware is new (WRT54G v5) and that there are known bugs, these are two, and the Linksys is working hard to come up with updated firmware. [tells, is, are, are, is, working, come, updated] [new, known]

They had me update my VERY <i> old firmware <i> . [had, update] [old]
After a lot of work they had me change my firmware to an older version, 1. [had, change] [older]
The process of upgrading the firmware went like this: 1) Upgrade firmware throught the IE interface. [upgrading, went, Upgrade] [firmware]
2) Push in & hold the reset button for 30 seconds 3) Unplug & replug the router 4) Re-enter my settings (because of the reset) The first time I upgraded the firmware, they skipped step 2! [Push, hold, replug, Re-enter, upgraded, skipped] [first]
So I don't know if it's the firmware version or if it's reseting the router, but my main constant dropped problem is solved. [do, know, 's, 's, reseting, dropped, is, solved] [main, constant]
After trying this for a couple of weeks I'll upgrade to the current firmware to see which of these 2 is the cause of the problem, as well as seeing if it fixed my OLD problem of having to restart the router  a couple of times a week. [trying, upgrade, see, is, seeing, having, restart] [current, fixed]
As a result, you won't be able to flash it with third party firmwares. [be, flash] [able, third]
After she suggested I 'kindly' update my firmware, my set up wizard crashed and I couldn't access half of the router's website anymore! [suggested, update, set, crashed, access] [website]
Followed instructions to upgrade firmware (shipped in 2012, but had older 2009 version it it? [Followed, upgrade, shipped, had] [older]
I have tried moving the router to a different physical location, changing the wireless communication channel, and upgrading the firmware from the Netgear website. [have, tried, moving, changing, upgrading] [different, physical, wireless]
A few years ago, I was one of the unlucky 'early adopters' of a Linksys 4 port router (wired type) and, for almost a year, had to endure continuous firmware updates before Linksys got that router's problems fixed. [was, wired, had, endure, got, fixed] [few, unlucky, early, port, continuous]
Two phone calls were made to Linksys tech support during which a firmware update to the 54G router and multiple resets of my cable modem and the 54G and reboots of my computer were required to get the 54G to connect on the WAN/Internet side of the router to the cable modem.

For anyone using older firmware, I recommend upgrading it by grabbing the image from the Linksys site. [using, recommend, upgrading, grabbing] [older]
the product failed after a firmware upgrade. [failed] [firmware]
I tried downloading the latest firmware, but to no avail. [tried, downloading] [latest]
If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I'd give it 4-5 stars. [release, give] [reliable, 4-5]

Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this). [being, instructed, reset, got, stuck, wanted, was] [firmware, apparent]
Worked great until the new firmware that installs SecureSpot. [installs] [Worked, great, new]
You may ask why not go back to the old firmware. [ask, go] [old]
The first few  <i> firmware revisions were a little bumpy <i> , but the problems I experienced were sorted out relatively quickly and the router was fast and stable - easily the best router I've owned (and there have been many). [were, experienced, were, sorted, was, 've, owned, have, been] [first, few, firmware, little, bumpy, fast, stable, best, many]
So, overall, I have to give this excellent piece of hardware 2 stars because of D-Link's awful recent firmware and support. [have, give] [overall, excellent, awful, recent]
If it was possible to revert to an older firmware, perhaps I would feel differently, but I have been forced to replace the router with a non-D-Link device as I work from home and need reliable internet connectivity and VOIP. [was, revert, feel, have, been, forced, replace, work, need] [possible, older, non-D-Link, reliable]
<p>  After repeated calls to the terribly unhelpful "technical support" (who seemed convinced that the problem was everything BUT the router - very suspicious - and who sent me firmware that refuses to install) and a sore neck from long hold times (at least 45mins.

This one had the latest firmware, so the bridge option was removed by Dlink. [had, was, removed] [latest]
The linksys people were clueless also , the sent me 3 different firmwares, but none worked ( even beta ones). [were, sent, worked] [clueless, different, beta]

The main problem is that you can't see the thing on your network and it has no port to connect to, so you can't configure it or upgrade the firmware--which is worthless and unusable. [is, see, has, connect, configure, upgrade, is] [main, worthless, unusable]
I've held on, hoping that a magic firmware update would be issued that would make all of the issues disappear. ['ve, held, hoping, update, be, issued, make, disappear] [magic]
My firmware is up to date, I've re-started it 50+ times, my internet is working fine (I'm on it now thanks to my old router), I just cannot get the router to connect to the internet. [is, 've, re-started, is, working, 'm, get, connect] [old]
With the newest firmware, the b devices and g devices work together very well. [work] [newest]
If you load that firmware, your wireless throughput will drop even further, and many of the functions like creating secondary ethernet bridges will completely cause the WAN to quit working. [load, drop, creating, cause, quit, working] [wireless, many, secondary]
This router use to be great, but with the new version 5 it's only got half the memory and can't be my 4rd party firmware installed. [be, 's, got, be, installed] [great, new, 4rd]
I didn't go for that because I had already tried the router somewhere else and used DD-WRT firmware which didn't work either so I knew it was not a software issue. [did, go, had, tried, used, did, work, knew, was] [DD-WRT]
i've upgraded the firmware, i've even took my router to my friend's house to see if the problem is universal, and yet it is! ['ve, upgraded, 've, took, see, is, is] [universal]

Turns out this version is very buggy and can't be upgraded to aftermarket firmware. [Turns, is, be, upgraded, aftermarket] [buggy]
The latest version of this product model has less RAM and runs a different firmware (essentially an operating system) than previous versions of the same product. [has, runs] [latest, less, different, previous, same]
As others noted below this router drops local connections constantly (2 to 3 times daily) I did not have this problem until I updated the firmware to the latest release: 1. [noted, drops, did, have, updated] [local, daily, latest]
Have been updating new firmware whenever a new one is available. [been, updating, is] [new, new, available]
However, with every new firmware, the quality seems gettign worse. [seems] [new, gettign, worse]
I had to go through talking to three or four   really novice support people before I finally got someone that gave me a firmware upgrade so that   the box would work. [had, go, talking, got, gave, work] [firmware]
The instructions on the self-help support webpage lead me to upgrade the firmware, and once that was complete, I have not been able to connect to the unit again. [lead, upgrade, was, have, been, connect] [self-help, complete, able]
As soon as I got it I downloaded the latest firmware (end of May 2010). [got, downloaded] [latest]
The advantages of the 1490 are all for naught without reliable firmware which this device lacks. [are, lacks] [reliable]
The abundance of capabilities of these new boxes requires <i> complicated firmware <i> which quite obviously the manufacturer is not able adequately to debug. [requires, is, debug] [new, complicated, able]
I have not tried 'eco route' related functionality I have updated map and software - so it has now latest firmware and map Basic functionality - add address/search address , navigation,interface is fine now i feel following issues - if anybody has any input let us know 1) when unit start - screen loads after "I agree" button ,it always make noise like "spark " or radio tunning for fraction of second and then it become normal.

I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. [have, had, use, love] [third]
Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware. [sat, figured, make, run] [smart, own]
So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux). [get, have, makes, run] [various, few]
The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be. [is, are, add, are, be] [neat, third, powerful, many, more]
Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware. [put, is, run, is, found, play] [small]
This is the 6th version of their firmware and they still haven't solved the problem! [is, have, solved] [6th]
I don't care if DD-WRT is better, I believe the router should work and be functional first with it's firmware. [do, care, is, believe, work, be, 's] [functional]
Downloaded the new 54G driver for the card and firmware for the router - still nothing (router is set to mixed mode and B card has latest firmware and driver, I also uninstalled the B card from my wife's laptop prior to installing the new G card). [Downloaded, is, set, has, uninstalled, installing] [new, mixed, latest, new]
The router's "stay alive" feature disappeared after installing the new firmware update. [stay, disappeared, installing, update] [alive, new]
He had me execute almost the same routine that I had perfomed prior to calling: I rolled back the card's driver to original (Win XP roll-back feature), uninstalled and reinstalled card from the control panel with reboots, reset the router, and rolled back to router's original firmware -- nothing. [had, execute, had, perfomed, calling, rolled, Win, reinstalled, reset, rolled, router] [same, routine, original, uninstalled, original]
Usually Netgear firmware (yes all of the routers have the latest Netgear  <i> firmware had to offer) is really buggy <i>  and takes about a year and half to get the issues work out. [have, had, offer, is, takes, get, work] [latest, buggy]
The 3700 now sets on a self waiting until firmware is released indicating these issues are fixed and my wife has forgotten about the struggles over this past week. [sets, waiting, is, released, indicating, are, fixed, has, forgotten] [past]
She then had me download a beta version firmware update, Version 1. [had, download, update] [beta]
This firmware update immediately fixed the problem, and I now have a stable Guest network running alongside the regular wireless SSIDs- the principal reason I upgraded to this router. [update, fixed, have, running, upgraded] [firmware, stable, regular, wireless, principal]
Hopefully the new firmware version will be posted soon on their website. [be, posted] [new]

So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. [called, got, directed, download, update, hung] [firmware]
Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. [got, got, helped, install, experience] [third, same, very, next]
Now I can't use the WRE54G because of the router  <i> firmware incompatability <i>  - the extender is unstable and basically useless. [use, is] [unstable, useless]

After a long session with tech support, I finally was told that the firmware recovery utility on the CD is apparently not expected to ever work, and they asked me to return the unit for a refund, which I did and ordered a D-Link.

I hoped to resolve these issues by updating the firmware for second time, but I could not. [hoped, resolve, updating] [second]
Next firmware update not expect until Q2 2011 according to the forum post above. [update, expect, according] [Next]
I think it's pathetic for a company to release firmware which has such an obvious flaw that end users are able to find it and post about it within 4 days of the firmware release, particularly when the problem IS THAT THE ROUTER DROPS THE NETWORK CONNECTION EVERY MINUTE.

Most Linksys products are incompatible with the most recent firmware version running on Vonage controlled routers. [are, running, controlled] [Most, incompatible, recent]

Those earlier routers run a flexible and powerful Linux based firmware that has been perfected for the past few years a numerous updates and tweaks. [run, based, has, been, perfected] [earlier, flexible, powerful, past, few, numerous]
Instead of the flexible, reliable and powerful Linux firmware the new WRT54G version 5 routers run the licensed VxWorks firmware instead. [run] [flexible, reliable, powerful, new, licensed]
The open source Linux firmware with the large amount of flash and system memory was attractive to many third party independent software developers that were turning the WRT54G and GS routers into powerhouse micro Linux wireless computers with a functionality approaching and often surpassing the $600+ wireless routers that Cisco sells. [was, were, turning, approaching, surpassing, sells] [open, large, attractive, many, third, independent, wireless, wireless]
There might also have been an excess number of product warranty returns for the WRT54G routers due to so many people flashing them with non-Linksys third party firmware that sometimes can "brick" a router or make it unusable. [have, been, flashing, make] [excess, due, many, non-Linksys, third, unusable]
Your solution is to either look for a previous version of the "WRT54G" router before version 5 or purchase the "WRT54GS" (SpeedBooster) version 4 which as of the posting of this review is still available in the stores and it still uses the popular Linux firmware. [is, purchase, posting, is, uses] [previous, available, popular]
If you want to use third party firmware you may want the GS versions 2. [want, use, want] [third]
Finally, if you do plan to flash your WRT54G with third party firmware the  ones before version 4 of the WRT54G wireless routers are supposed to be easier to work with. [do, plan, flash, are, supposed, be, work] [third, wireless, easier]
1) are the most flexible for use with third party firmware. [are] [flexible, third]
Unless you want to use a more risky third party firmware I recommend that you read the manual instructions on how to carefully flash these older router models with a newer Linksys firmware which is designed for that specific router version. [want, use, recommend, read, flash, is, designed] [risky, third, manual, older, newer, specific]
The latest official Linksys firmware for each specific version of router can be obtained from the Linksys support site. [be, obtained] [latest, official, specific]
You will see the "CGN6" serial numbers on the box and as of this review these were still using Linux firmware with software based SpeedBoost enhancements but the RAM and hardware inside seems to be essentially the same as the older WRT54G (v4. [see, were, using, based, seems, be] [serial, same, older]
0 (CGN5) are also good and will have more flash RAM available if you want use the wireless router with third party firmware. [are, have, want, use] [good, more, available, wireless, third]
I would like to note that flashing the router with firmware other than an official Linksys releases obtained from the Linksys support web site will void the warranty and can result in a "bricked" or damaged router. [like, note, flashing, obtained, void, result, bricked, damaged] [firmware, other, official]
Previous versions could be flashed with powerful third party firmware. [be, flashed] [Previous, powerful, third]
0 routers can still be purchased and except for the SpeedBoost software enhancement (including a different version of Linux based firmware) they are essentially the same as older WRT54G v4. [be, purchased, including, based, are] [different, same, older]
CONS: The latest version 5 has less Flash and System RAM and uses a  <i> buggy non-Linux based firmware <i> . [has, uses, based] [latest, less, buggy, non-Linux]
) CONCLUSION: With all the changes to the memory and the firmware this latest G model is really a very different product and Cisco should have changed the model number altogether. [is, have, changed] [latest, different]
Older firmware does not have this problem, so a newly installed router may not. [does, have, installed] [Older]
Now it turns out that I was shipped the V5 version of this router which has been modified to NOT run this popular, powerful, inexpensive firmware. [turns, was, shipped, has, been, modified, run] [popular, powerful, inexpensive]

Note these issues exist even as of the latest firmware at the time of this review (v4. [Note, exist] [latest]
I was told that the firmware that was installed with initial setup is flawed and the additional "support" that's been put out is also flawed, so it was removed from the company website. [was, told, was, installed, is, flawed, 's, been, put, is, flawed, was, removed] [initial, additional]
I owned this router for 9 months, works perfectly once I tried and error to different version of firmware and connection is speedy, steady and no drop signal. [owned, works, tried, is] [different, speedy, steady]

I tried to upgraded and downgrade a few firmware, nothing improve to the signal strength. [tried, upgraded, improve] [few]
If they said firmware, it is still belongs to Netgear support, they can suggest me to search the answer from the forum, but they did not, the only option is to pay for software support, it is completely insane. [said, is, belongs, suggest, search, did, is, pay, is] [only, insane]
I have tried updating the firmware, reverting to old firmware and everything in between. [have, tried, updating, reverting] [old]
Apparently Linksys is having <i> firmware issues <i> on several models (that's what the best buy guy said). [is, having, 's, said] [several, best]

However, after downloading the latest firmware from the Linksys web site (the 1. [downloading] [latest]
I've given the product 3 stars because of how easy it is to set up and because it works as advertised with the firmware upgrade. ['ve, given, is, set, works, advertised] [easy]

Pros (they don't outweigh the cons, but here they are): Gigabit ethernet works well for the home network Range is great along with speeds Firmware has lots of great tweaks if you are technically inclined Looks slick Cons: Sporadically quits working with the internet connection (home network stays up), confirmed this is not an ISP or modem issue D-Link support (even the manual and website are incorrect at times) Must update firmware to get it to even work at an aggravatingly livable level To start off, I have had a horrible experience with this product.

Completely reflashed the firmware recently as a possible fix for the connectivity issues mentioned below. [reflashed, mentioned] [possible]
It actually used to happen more when I first got the unit (I incorrectly thought it was the ISP at fault at the time), but the first firmware update in February 2010 got it up to a more stable state. [used, happen, got, thought, was, update, got] [more, first, stable]
However, the level of reliability is still far from acceptable (even after a subsequent firmware update). [is, update] [acceptable, subsequent]

Netgear should have left well enough alone with firmware v1. [have, left] [enough, firmware]
UPDATE 2011/11/15: Smallnetbuilder dot com stuck with firmware version v1. [UPDATE, dot, stuck] [firmware]
The rationale behind the paranoid flash procedure is to make sure that another firmware version's setup (usually a slightly different size when backup-stored, with slightly different options) doesn't corrupt the the new firmware footprint (I guess).

Hours of frustrating calls to customer service, 2 replacements, and several firmware upgrades later, I gave up and decided to use only the wired switch. [frustrating, gave, decided, use, wired] [several]

Despite the fact that Linksys (owned by Cisco) has had firmware updates for its WRT54G router to support WPA2 since at least August 2005, it still has not bothered to update this product. [owned, has, had, support, has, bothered, update] [firmware, least]
Linksys has done the wireless community a great disservice by making it incompatible with third-party firmware that has more functionality than Linksys's own proprietary firmware. [has, done, making, has] [wireless, great, incompatible, third-party, more, own, proprietary]
The extra price is worth it, though, since the third-party firmware lets you increase the gain on the antennas and turn your routers into gateways, among other nifty features. [is, lets, increase, turn] [extra, worth, third-party, other, nifty]
All-in-all, the WRT54G is a good starter model for those who don't want to mod, but the extra $15 for the WRT54GL would be worth it for anyone who plans on a true firmware upgrade. [is, do, want, mod, be, plans] [good, starter, extra, worth, true]
I haven't tried customer support--not sure it's worth it, last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router, update the firmware--and still had the same issues. [have, tried, 's, had, took, tell, reset, update, had] [sure, worth, last, similar, same]

I have heard that the version 4 of this router (the current version) doesn't work very well, but I was shocked when the firmware upload made the unit completely useless! [have, heard, does, work, was, shocked, made] [current, useless]
And nope, the new <i> firmware hasn't fixed <i> the issue. [keeps, releasing, has, done] [new, damn]
<p>Linksys tech support suggested upgrading to the most recent firmware, but the website specifically says not to upgrade the version 4 router with that very patch. [suggested, upgrading, says, upgrade] [recent, website]
I finally got it working by talking to engineers I work with at work, as far as how to configure each PC, and also Linksys gave me a firmware patch by email that seemed to make the PPPoE login work much better. [got, working, talking, work, configure, gave, seemed, make] [firmware]
In retrospect, I got spoiled by Apple and had forgotten that with Netgear (and the other router brands) you have to deal with weekly reboots, buggy firmware and incorrect information (how difficult is it for Netgear to finally figure out what devices with what IP addresses are attached to a Netgear router?

There is an application on line by a Russian developer that hacks the 655 and lets you down grad the firmware backwards. [is, hacks, lets] [Russian]

The wireless intermittently cuts out completely (ie, the lights on the front indicate it is no longer providing wireless service), the port-forwarding completely broke in the latest version of the firmware, there are no docs for the updated firmware, even though the web interface has changed and added new features, and the docs have no information for using the router with anything other than Windows.

The Range Expander is supposed to work out of the box with that router, but this was not the case, even with the latest WRT54G firmware (3. [is, supposed, work, was] [latest, WRT54G]
The WRE54G Range Expander does not currently support WPA (allegedly there is a firmware update to fix this but good luck finding it). [does, support, is, update, fix, finding] [firmware, good]
What I ended up doing was installing alternative open source firmware on my WRT54G router (this is legal because the Linksys firmware is GPL'd). [ended, doing, was, installing, is, is] [alternative, open, legal]
Do a search for &#34;satori firmware&#34; and you should be able to find it. [Do, firmware, be, find] [able]

I have changed the firmware numerous times. [have, changed] [firmware, numerous]
I've tried all the workarounds, from updating the firmware to using a secure connection - and nothing really helps. ['ve, tried, updating, using, helps] [secure]
Bottom line, the online documentation (yeah, nothing in the stuff that comes with it) indicates the minimum version of firmware for your WRT54G should be 2. [comes, indicates, be] [online, yeah, minimum]
version, so I wasted a lot of time before I went to their website looking for upgrades to the WRE firmware, which is where they indicate the minimum version required. [wasted, went, looking, is, indicate, required] [website]
Anyway, I finally gave up, only to find months later that there is indeed a problem with this router's firmware (related to DNS name resolution, which causes an intermittent but consistently occurring disconnection on the WAN port). [gave, find, is, related, causes, occurring] [intermittent]
Since then, they've told the masses that they have a firmware fix, but it's just more of the same crapware, just with an updated version number (and with the word "beta" attached - doesn't that just make you warm and fuzzy?

This router is a good fit for general purpose as long as you: - Don't upgrade the firmware - Don't have a high traffic - Don't use the built-in USB feature We upgraded the firmware because we needed to use the built-in USB feature, and the nightmare began: - The router is frozen and required reboot, few times a day.

Tomato does not have this shortcoming of Linksys firmware and has a bunch of other nice features. [does, have, has] [other, nice]
I use a WRT54GL with Tomato firmware installed, and I higly recommend it as the best and most stable wireless router option you can use. [use, installed, recommend, use] [WRT54GL, best, stable, wireless]
