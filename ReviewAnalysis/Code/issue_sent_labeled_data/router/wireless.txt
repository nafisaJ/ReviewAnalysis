Still, this wireless adapter software had no provisions for WEP (only WPA2), so the agent attempted to get Windows to manage the card, with no success. [had, attempted, get, manage] [wireless]

I bought the WGR614v6 and a wireless NIC when my Ethernet card broke. [bought, broke] [wireless]
Alas, the router's wireless interface is disabled until you physically plug in an Ethernet cable and configure it. [is, plug, configure] [wireless, disabled]
I took the WGR614 to work hoping that I could set it up there and convince it to turn on its wireless interface. [took, work, hoping, set, convince, turn] [wireless]
Ok, I've gotten to be quite familiar with the wireless LinkSys products and their misleading descriptions. ['ve, gotten, be] [familiar, wireless, misleading]
However, occasionally, I would have  <i> wireless connectivity issues <i> . [have] [wireless]
I bought this to replace an aging Netgear WGR614; I use the router as both an internal router for my home LAN (behind a separate router which functions as my firewall) and as a wireless access point. [bought, replace, aging, use] [internal, separate, wireless]
I tried and it told me to that it couldn't find the wireless point -- site survey failed. [tried, told, find, failed] [wireless]
As most users point out, ignore the documentation unless you are on a wireless island. [point, ignore, are] [most, wireless]

It is too early to know if the first goal has been achieved, but I am very  <i> disappointed with the wireless <i>  coverage. [is, know, has, been, achieved, am, disappointed] [early, first, wireless]

I bought Linksys's wireless router because after doing some research and from a personal recomenadation from a friend that had their four-port router (the non-wireless equivalent) I determined that they were the best.

This replaced a Netgear BEFW11S4 router, which was hideously inept at keeping its wireless signal up or doing port-forwarding. [replaced, was, keeping, doing] [inept, wireless]
As I work, I can see the  <i> wireless signal drop <i>  from full strength to nothing for a few seconds, then come back. [work, see, come] [wireless, full, few]
At other times, I've turned on a computer to find the signal gone and unwilling to come back - this can be fixed by plugging into an ethernet port, visiting the configuration page and simply "OK"ing the wireless settings, without changing anything.

Of course, if ethernet were convenient to me, I wouldn't need the wireless. [were, need] [convenient, wireless]

Every time I tried to get my money back, they connected me to an engineer who either went through the same steps with me again, or explained to me that since my Roku worked wirelessly, there must be nothing wrong with my router, and therefore it must be a Canon problem.

This router works well when you use the wired network, however, not being able to use the wireless defeats the whole purpose of a "wireless" router. [works, use, wired, being, use, defeats] [able, wireless, whole, wireless]
I purchased my router from bestbuy, and after a month of use, I kept getting disconnected from my wireless connection and the signal would decrease as soon as I connected. [purchased, kept, getting, disconnected, decrease, connected] [bestbuy, wireless]
Old versions gave horrible performance, wired and wireless. [gave, wired] [horrible, wireless]

Put the router on the first machine and installed a wireless card on a PC in the basement. [Put, installed] [first, wireless]

Using the router's simple web interface, I configured WEP keys for the router &amp; my wireless card. [Using, configured] [simple, wireless]
So anytime I want to use the router securely, I've got to: 1) disable WEP on my wireless card 2) re-acquire a DHCP address 3) regenerate WEP keys with the router's web interface 4) enable WEP on my wireless card with generated key 5) re-acquire DHCP<p>You may imagine this makes security prohibitively inconvenient. [want, use, 've, got, regenerate, enable, generated, imagine, makes] [disable, wireless, wireless, key, inconvenient]
So I'd recommend it only if you are planning for continuous uptime or live in an area where you don't have to worry about others intercepting your wireless transmissions. [recommend, are, planning, live, do, have, worry, intercepting] [continuous, wireless]

I bought this router to form a wireless bridge between a netgear WNR3500L and this unit. [bought, form] [wireless]
I also attempted to pair this with a wireless N adapter to connect a machine in the same remote room. [attempted, pair, connect] [wireless, same, remote]
I was totally unable to get this to cooperate with a the dlink extreme wireless N PCI express adapter. [was, get, cooperate, express] [unable, dlink, extreme, wireless]
By contrast, with the WNR3500L acting as my master router, the dlink wireless N card functioned okay with a average throughput around 3. [acting, functioned] [dlink, wireless, okay, average]
I cannot advise using this unit to form a wireless bridge. [advise, using, form] [wireless]
It might work fine if paired with a different wireless N adapter. [work, paired] [fine, different, wireless]
On a side note, I bought a second WNR3500L in order or form a wireless bridge and found the performance similar to pairing the WNDR3700 with a WNR3500L. [bought, form, found, pairing] [second, wireless, similar]

I started my quest for better wireless coverage looking at the HGA7T antenna, and read a report there suggesting the Linksys WRE54G range expander device was a better solution. [started, looking, read, suggesting, was] [better, wireless, better]
The concept of the WRE54G is a good one - the ability to extend the wireless coverage. [is, extend] [good, wireless]
Also, I hope you realize that once the WRE54G is installed, it cuts your effective wireless throughput in half (which may or may not matter, given that most people's broadband bandwidth is still slower). [hope, realize, is, installed, cuts, matter, given, is] [effective, wireless, most, slower]
I'm moving on to try the HGA7T instead - a fraction of the price of the WRE54G, much simpler solution that should be "good enough" and provide a stronger wireless signal that has better coverage than a single room (oh yeah, the WRE54G supposedly only boosts the signal significantly in the room in which it's installed, and the antenna should increase the signal broadly around the house).
