Unfortunately, I am sending them back for 2 different reasons: (1) When wearing the earbuds the  <i> cord/wire somehow "create" noise  <i> that interferes with your music listening. [am, sending, wearing, create, interferes, listening] [different]
If you turn the music off completely and then just listens to the noise created by moving your head you will see what I mean -- it is especially bad when wearing a jacket as the cord/ <i> wire rub across the collar <i>  constantly. [turn, listens, created, moving, see, mean, is, wearing] [bad]
I do however have some pain points: First, the "stethoscope" effect is actually quite bad unless you run the headset under your shirt and/or tighten the  <i> wire under your chin <i> . [do, have, is, run, tighten] [bad]
Make no mistake about it, the J3's are beautiful, solid aluminum construction, awsome clear coat wire that does not tangle. [are, does, tangle] [beautiful, solid, awsome, clear]
Sounds like one of the  <i> wire got torn <i> , cause the right ear sometimes gets no sound. [Sounds, got, torn, cause, gets] [right]
The silver part with the actual speaker came loose from its black base and now the  <i> innards are exposed, wire  <i> and all. [came, are, exposed] [actual, black]
I use them at the gym primarily, and working out is OK - but doing cardio, I have to snake it down my back, under my t-shirt, cord held down by my cardio monitor strap to minimize the sounds of the cord /  <i> wire bumping <i>  my t-shirt when moving! [use, working, is, doing, have, held, minimize, bumping, moving] [OK]
These ear buds seemed good for the price but once I started using them I realized why the were so inexpensive compared to the other noise reducing ear buds the workmanship on them is pretty bad the wiring very low quality, after a week the connection started messing up and I  <i> have to bend the wire  <i> to be able to hear anything the sounds is not too bad again for the price but could be better. [seemed, started, using, realized, were, compared, reducing, is, started, messing, have, bend, be, hear, is, be] [good, inexpensive, other, bad, low, able, bad]
Sound quality is good, they are attractive and the wire never get tangled. [is, are, get, tangled] [Sound, good, attractive]
The  <i> wire connection to the right earbud became unreliable <i>  after only a couple months, and the left one soon followed a month later. [became, left, followed] [right, unreliable, couple]
I'm not a big fan of the glossy plastic cover over the entire wire either. ['m] [big, glossy, entire]
There is a clever plastic slider on the wire that makes adjusting these earphones easy if you run. [is, makes, adjusting, run] [clever, easy]
I liked the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (the lower-end headphones from this manufacturer) until the  <i> wire broke <i> . [liked, broke] [lower-end]
I had these headphones for about 2 weeks before one of the headphone acme apart and was only held together by the thin speaker wire. [had, was, held] [thin]
However, after about 3 months the right earbud stopped working and I  <i> have to hold the wire <i>  just the right way to hear anything from the left earbud. [stopped, working, have, hold, hear, left] [right, right]
Same thing happened, I've had them for about 3 months now and I have to <i> wiggle the wire  <i> and hold it the right way to keep any kind of sound. [happened, 've, had, have, wiggle, hold, keep] [Same, right]
My first set had a  <i> loose-wire-tye buzzing  <i> in one ear. [had, buzzing] [first, loose-wire-tye]
These earphones have good sound and I found they fit my ear nicely, but as, many reviews stated, the  <i> wire are thin <i>  and the rubber tips fall off and get lost. [have, found, fit, stated, are, fall, get, lost] [good, many, thin]
I started having to  <i> wiggle the wire  <i> on the ipod end after about 3 months and it was just getting too annoying to handle when I lost first one medium, then one large tip. [started, having, wiggle, was, getting, annoying, handle, lost] [ipod, large]
but the most troubling thing about these headpones is when you move your head just 1 milimeter, the  <i> wire will brush up  <i> against something and it will reverberate in your ears very loudly. [is, move, brush, reverberate] [troubling]
this HAS to be due to the  <i> poor insulation in the wire <i> . [HAS, be] [due, poor]
they were perfect for sleeping until the  <i> wire tore <i>  the problem is the wire connected to the ear bud were torn out and now one ear bud died. [were, sleeping, tore, is, connected, were, torn, died] [perfect]
- The first pair I received broke on the second day (the earbud/speaker separated from the plastic cone/casing, <i> disconnecting the wire <i> ). [received, broke, separated, cone\, disconnecting] [first, second]
If I fiddle with the  <i> wire near the jack I can occasionally get sound  <i> to come out but no permanent fix. [get, sound, come] [permanent]
Beside the fact that the wire from the one I purchased on ebay which are much beefier then jlab's ear buds. [purchased, are] [much, beefier]
I was at school on friday (6/4) and I went to take the earphones out of my ear when the speaker stayed in my ear and was still attached to the actual earphone by wire only. [was, went, take, stayed, was, attached] [actual]
The cable is better than your standard plastic-coated headphone wire, and the earbud casings themselves are metal and should be able to take a beating. [is, are, be, take] [better, standard, plastic-coated, earbud, able]
The wiring isn't very well designed because my right headphone gets no more sound (unless I align and  <i> twist the wire  <i> in just the right angle). [is, designed, gets, align, twist] [right, sound, right]
Neutral: The wire are equal length (Y-style). [are] [Neutral, equal, Y-style]
The  <i> wire are stiff <i> , which prevents tangling and fraying, but also means it can be difficult to manipulate them, like if you want to curl them above and behind your ears to keep them out of the way. [are, prevents, means, be, manipulate, want, curl, keep] [stiff, difficult]
I did what previous reviews stated, and played around with ear placement, and finding the best way to have them sit in my ears for the best sound, and during that process, the Left Bud basically split into two pieces, and the part that goes in your ear are now hanging by the two wire. [did, stated, played, finding, have, sit, Left, split, goes, are, hanging] [previous, best, best]
The wire on the original buds are supple and feel nice. [are, feel] [original, supple, nice]
The  <i> wire on these buds don't move <i>  as nice and will kink more. [do, move, kink] [nice]
The fault point on all Jbuds is always the same, the  <i> wire gets over-stretched <i>  or worked right near the Jack. [is, gets, worked] [same, over-stretched]
pretty much living be ready to listen to every movement and touch of the wire. [living, be, listen] [ready]
The mic is pretty sensitive too, but the  <i> annoying thumping sound of the wire <i>  moving or touching your chest or hands makes them very hard to like. [is, thumping, moving, touching, makes, like] [sensitive]
I think this may have to do with the fact that the speaker housing, made of aluminum combined with the thicker, sturdy wire, kept trying to pull them out. [think, have, do, made, combined, kept, trying, pull] [thicker, sturdy]
The sound comes back on, but I have to keep my head, the wire, and the ipod perfectly still - any movement, and the right earphone cuts out again. [comes, have, keep, cuts] [right]
About a week later, neither of the buds would work except if you moved around the wire near the audio jack. [work, moved] [audio]
The  <i> wire don't tangle <i>  if you keep them in your gym bag most of the time like I do. [do, tangle, keep, do] [most]
The first pair died on me after about 5 months of wear, one of the speakers went out due to a  <i> lose wire  <i> near the connection to the MP3 player. [died, went, lose] [first, due]
If I  <i> tweaked the wire <i>  at the right point just a little, it would come back, but I would have to hold it there. [tweaked, come, have, hold] [right, little]
This pair just failed a few days ago with the exact same problem, except now it doesn't even fix itself when  <i> I twist the wire <i> . [failed, does, fix, twist] [few, exact, same]
I had been quite pleased with my very first pair until the left  <i> wire was frayed  <i> inside right under the actual earphone unit despite it only being used for my computer for 6 weeks in a safe environment. [had, been, was, frayed, being, used] [pleased, first, left, actual, earphone, safe]
After the wire in my Jbuds J2s started to malfunction after about five months(which is a remarkably long time for my earbuds to last)I thought I'd buy another pair. [started, is, thought, buy] [long, last]
I bought these as yet another pair of my Maximo-HS2's had developed a  <i> short in the wire <i>  and I could no longer hear out of one ear. [bought, had, developed, hear] [short]
The good news is the connections and wire do appear to be more likely to resist wear and tear than the Maximo's, which is why I decided to switch. [is, do, appear, be, resist, tear, is, decided, switch] [good, likely]
Any little hit, rub, tug or anything to the wire when in use seems to cause the sound to jump around. [seems, cause, jump] [little]
Noise isolation was great with the headphones on, but  <i> wire noise is rampant <i> . [was, is] [great, rampant]
These headphones have a great sound - crisp with lots of bass - and they block outside noise very well - but the  <i> wire in the plug eventually became loose <i> , and though for a few days I was able to "jiggle" the cable to get sound, they eventually quit completely. [have, block, became, was, jiggle, get, quit] [great, crisp, outside, loose, few, able, sound]
The wired remote stopped working within a few weeks of purchase. [wired, stopped, working] [remote, few]
It wasn't until last week when the speaker became loose of the encasing and just hangs by the wire, granted I did use the earbuds really heavily. [was, became, encasing, hangs, granted, did, use] [last, loose]
Whatever the coating on the wire does to try and make it difficult to tangle (difficult, not impossible), it ends up conducting the sound of the friction quite loudly. [does, try, make, tangle, ends, conducting] [difficult, difficult, impossible]
And, last but not least, the rubber cord wrap where the wire and the plug meets is already showing signs of cracking -- which I'm sure is only an indicator of the overall build quality of these "quality" headphones. [meets, is, showing, cracking, 'm, is, build] [last, least, sure, overall]
I accidentally broke my coby headphones that came with the mp3 player, and although you have to get the smallest ear-bud and stick it in your ear these have better sound quality and are louder than my coby headphones, for $10 these are good, not the $50 they originally were but If I needed another pair I'd buy again Update:6/11/2012 These are flimsy headphones and will not last long at all as they are already broken and have become trash and I do not recommend you get these headphones as they will not last long and will surely disappoint you, and you'd be better off getting headphones with thicker wire so they dont break so easily. [broke, came, have, get, stick, have, are, are, were, needed, buy, are, last, are, broken, have, become, do, recommend, get, last, disappoint, be, getting, dont] [coby, mp3, smallest, ear-bud, better, sound, coby, good, flimsy, long, better, thicker]
It always starts with the left headphone going out, and having to  <i> hold the wire  <i> in a certain position to get audio to come out from the left earphone. [starts, going, having, hold, get, come] [left, certain, audio, left]
The two buds are widened by simply prying apart the two wire. [are, widened] [prying]
It's more like a wire than a normal headphone cord. ['s] [more, normal]
Something went  <i> wrong in the connection between wire <i>  and the base of the headphone plug. [went] [wrong]
Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then  <i> wire started to show  <i> so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds. [wrap, started, show, stopped, put, listened, got, hear] [durable, worse]
When I'm walking, the  <i> joggling of the wire <i>  produce a slight acoustic 'thump' inside my ear canal. ['m, walking, produce] [slight, acoustic]
Anyway, the little rubber things fall off too easy, and I have just had to replace them because the  <i> wire has a short <i>  in it right where the jack goes into the ipod, and sound only comes out of one side unless you hold the cord steady. [fall, have, had, replace, has, goes, sound, comes, hold] [little, easy, short, steady]
Within a week or two, it had completely separated and was held together only by the internal wire but could be snapped back into place. [had, separated, was, held, be, snapped] [internal]
The  <i> wire is EXTREMELY thin <i>  (you can tell in the picture), I'm concerned that the  <i> wire will kink  <i> or break. [is, tell, 'm, kink, break] [thin, concerned]
No seriously, the  <i> wire on these headphones are uber thin <i> . [are] [uber, thin]
I lost sound in the right piece and I have to  <i> fiddle with the wire <i>  to get broken sound in the left. [lost, have, get] [right, broken]
Thought it was a  <i> short in the wire <i> , but even moving it around does nothing (good or bad), it just comes on and goes out randomly when I move during my workout. [was, moving, does, comes, goes, move] [short, good, bad]
I think issues with ear buds tend to relate to the cord not being thick and sturdy enough to protect the wire within. [think, tend, relate, being, protect] [thick, sturdy, enough]
I have used these for literally less than one week, light usage, really; they have already become useless in the same way every other pair of these I have had previously have become useless: the wire has  <i> shorted-out where the wire <i>  connects to the plug. [have, used, have, become, have, had, have, become, has, connects] [less, light, useless, same, other, useless, shorted-out]
If I manipulate the  <i> wire I can momentarily hear the sound <i>  in the Left earbud, then it shorts-out again. [manipulate, hear, Left] [shorts-out]
The internal  <i> wire broke off  <i> within 4 weeks. [broke] [internal]
They are GREAT headphones the sound is great and I like the black color but after 6 months the right headphone always loses sound I guess the  <i> wire get tangled <i>  from when I wrap it around my ipod. [are, is, like, loses, guess, get, tangled, wrap] [GREAT, great, black, right, sound]
Amazon had the black version for $40, free shipping, and I was about to order them when I found a 3rd-party seller on amazon (usedmarket24open) offering the S version (silver and black earpieces, but the wire are solid black) for $20 plus $5 shipping (<a href="http://www. [had, was, order, found, offering, are] [black, free, 3rd-party, black, solid, black]
If you firmly pull the entire length of the wire though, as if smoothing a rumpled cloth, you can push the cover back into place and  <i> recover the wire  <i> with a bit of effort. [pull, smoothing, push, recover] [entire, rumpled]
The same thing happened twice the  <i> wire comes out from the ear peice <i> ! [happened, comes] [same]
After a couple of months eventually one ear-piece stopped working (which seems to be the case with headphones in general, usually from a  <i> worn wire  <i> within the cable so it didn't bother me and actually took a while to occur since the cable is sturdy enough). [stopped, working, seems, be, did, bother, took, occur, is] [ear-piece, general, worn, sturdy]
I assume that the internal  <i> wire has frayed <i> , and reading other reviews it seems that this is a very common problem with these ear phones. [assume, has, frayed, reading, seems, is] [internal, other, common]
It sometimes work when you  <i> bend the wire <i>  a certain way but really, who can be bothered- it's junk now. [work, bend, be, bothered, 's] [certain]
The problem in all cases is one side becomes unreliable and then goes altogether as the connection between the plug and  <i> wire fails <i> . [is, becomes, goes, fails] [unreliable]
Also, the  <i> wire are much too short <i> , and the exposed metal bits on the buds shock my ears whenever there's static electricity (carpet, blankets, etc). [are, exposed, 's] [short, static]
The  <i> wire inside the cord are equally thin <i>  and broke next to the elbow connector after about 6 months of use, rendering the earbuds useless. [are, broke, rendering] [thin, next, useless]
I gave these 3 stars because within the first week the phones began  <i> shorting out in the area where the wire <i>  connects to the 1/8'' plug. [gave, began, shorting, connects] [first]
Once you move and the wire barely brushes anything, there is  <i> terrible feedback that travels up the wire  <i> and right into your ears. [move, is, travels] [terrible]
The  <i> wire are kind <i>  of stiff, and I suppose that's why. [are, suppose, 's] [stiff]
These J-buds are a cool design (I really like the sliding thing that lets you tighten the wire close to your chin), but to me they make the music sound dull. [are, sliding, lets, tighten, make] [cool, dull]
I changed from smallest size to the biggest size but it always gets hurt in my ear, also it so easy drop because the  <i> wire are so heavy <i>  compare to the earpieces. [changed, gets, hurt, are, compare] [smallest, biggest, easy, heavy]
I have to twist and  <i> turn the wire in order to hear sound  <i> in the right ear now. [have, twist, turn, hear] [right]
The plastic is just  <i> not very protective of the wire  <i> inside. [is] [protective]
I bought these earphones about 6 months ago when the cord on my original iPod earbuds started to strip and you could  <i> see the wire <i> . [bought, started, see] [original, iPod]
While running, instead of hearing the music, I hear a steady metronome coming from the  <i> wire hitting my chest <i> . [running, hearing, hear, coming, hitting] [steady]
I liked this earbuds, but after a while (long time period but light use) both speakers detached from the shells containing them, then the  <i> wire broke <i> , game over. [liked, detached, containing, broke] [long, light]
The  <i> wire do look a bit flimsy <i> , but they've held up so far. [do, look, 've, held] [flimsy]
I used them for 2 months anyway, until the left ear bud lost it's sound (I think from a break in the internal wire). [used, left, lost, 's, think] [sound, internal]
The wire coating is soft and they are light and comfortable to wear. [is, are, wear] [soft, light, comfortable]
Also, there is  <i> no permanent joint in the wire <i> , and when you first get them you have to rip the cords apart yourself and hope they don't rip any more. [is, get, have, rip, hope, do, rip] [permanent, more]
However, after a few weeks I noticed the plastic cover on the left  <i> wire was beginning to tear <i>  right underneath the earbud. [noticed, was, beginning, tear] [few, left, right]
A few weeks later the <i>  wire wore <i>  through due to being unprotected, and now the left earbud doesn't work. [wore, being, left, does, work] [few, due, unprotected]
The  <i> wire are shoddy <i> . [are] [shoddy]
The  <i> wire must have come loose <i>  near the audio jack because whenever I move them a certain way I will get sound (however it doesn't stay working). [have, come, move, get, does, stay, working] [audio, certain, sound]
I've owned the J3 Micro Atomic Earphone in Purplelicious for only about 2 weeks, and there's already some short of  <i> short in the wire <i> . ['ve, owned, 's] [short, short]
One minute, I hear static until I move the wire around, then if I make the slightest move, the sound completely goes out in one of the buds, and I have to move the wire around again. [hear, move, make, goes, have, move] [static, slightest, sound]
The  <i> wire seperated <i>  at the joint and at base of bud, causing static sounds after only 1 month. [seperated, causing] [joint, static]
The sound is good however if the wire is touched or bumped you get major feedback. [is, is, touched, bumped, get] [good, major]
The JBuds stuck in my ears great, but the minute I moved, there was all kinds of peripheral noise from the  <i> wire that completely destroyed <i>  the listening experience. [stuck, moved, was, destroyed, listening] [great, peripheral]
Read some reviews stating that the  <i> wire were weak <i>  and prone to damage so I tried to take very good care of mine (never bent or kinked). [Read, stating, were, tried, take] [weak, prone, good, bent, kinked]
The wire length is perfect. [is] [perfect]
The  <i> wire noise is too distracting <i> . [is] [distracting]
The right side broke because the  <i> wire the connects to the ear piece became loose <i> , and the left side had the same problem but it happened on the part where it connects to the plug. [broke, connects, became, had, happened, connects] [right, loose, left, same]
I found out by accident that the  <i> wire leading into the mic was loose <i> . [found, leading, was] [loose]
When I jiggled the wire, the earbud worked--but I had to hold the wire in place! [jiggled, worked, had, hold] [earbud]
So the sound on these was really pretty decent for the first 7 months, but the bast of the  <i> wire, right near the connector always felt a little weak <i>  to me. [was, felt] [decent, first, little, weak]
Well it finally happend, one of the copper  <i> wire inside must have finally worked itself loose <i> , as I lose my left headphone completely. [happend, have, worked, lose] [loose, left]
The quality of the wire is different than the original one I bought, so I think JLab is using cheaper materials now. [is, bought, think, is, using] [different, original, cheaper]
But in January 2011, one of the buds' speakers fell out of the headphone portion, the only thing that holds it together is the speaker's wire, the speaker is dangling out. [fell, holds, is, is, dangling] [only]
That said, after ~4 months or so of normal use with my phone in my pocket, the base of the connector  <i> wire started fraying <i> , such that one of the ears no longer works consistently. [said, started, fraying, works] [normal, such]
It is dead most of the time, unless i wiggle the wire just so to re-enable some presumably severed contact now. [is, wiggle, re-enable, severed] [dead, most]
At first, if I wiggled the jack or held the wire a certain way, and remained perfectly still, it'd come back but only go out again. [wiggled, held, remained, come, go] [certain]
There is a little cover over the wire where it attatches at the ipod and it's not welded or glued so it just pulled apart after a few times of taking it out of the ipod. [is, attatches, 's, welded, glued, pulled, taking] [little, few]
Basically in any instance the <i>  wire bounce off  <i> of something as soft as your cotton shirt the sound is amplified and shot right into your ears which totally ruins the mood of any song. [bounce, is, amplified, shot] [soft]
(Also, the squishy part of the ear bud ripped) I pressed the dislocated part and wire back into the main casing, and it still plays noise, but I'm concerned at how flimsy they were. [ripped, pressed, plays, 'm, concerned, were] [squishy, dislocated, main, flimsy]
when i plug it into my phone the angle of the  <i> wire curve and create a static sound <i>  where i can only hear the background music and not the words (other earphones work perfectly fine). [create, hear, work] [static, other, fine]
However, after almost a 18 months of usage, one of the buds went silent as apparently some of the smaller wire inside the casing leading to the jack became detached at the base of the plug. [went, casing, leading, became, detached] [silent, smaller]
I'm guessing the <i>  wire became bent/separated <i>  at the part where they connect to the hard metal piece that plugs into the ipod/computer. ['m, guessing, became, bent\, connect, plugs] [hard]
So JLabs you get 2 stars because I am sure you tried to produce a good product and for the appealing packaging and aesthetic design of the ear-buds but minus 3 stars for the piece of wire junction that is midway between the ear-buds and the connection to  my ipod that keeps hitting my chest and leaving a dud sound every time I try to listen to music. [get, am, tried, produce, is, keeps, hitting, leaving, try, listen] [sure, good, appealing, aesthetic]
if i move the  <i> wire around theres static <i> . [move] [static]
When I get the time, I'll re-solider the wire back on and glue the pieces together, but it's hardly worth the hassle. [get, re-solider, 's] [worth]
The  <i> wire and plug are of much lower quality <i>  than the original Apple earbuds. [are] [lower, original]
Unless JLab has significantly improved the quality of the materials (the plug and wire), I would stay clear of these. [has, improved, stay] [clear]
The  <i> wire is cracked  <i> right by the connector and they is too much static to be able to use them. [is, cracked, is, be, use] [much, static, able]
But they have a  <i> short in the wire <i> . [have] [short]
I believe that the defect occured within the section where the single  <i> wire splits <i>  into two wire. [believe, occured, splits] [single]
From the look only, it seems like the internal wire that make up the headphones are encased in a metal or metal-like sheath and then surrounded by a rubber or silicone casing. [seems, make, are, encased, surrounded] [internal, metal-like]
In addition, the design of the wire splitter for left and right earbuds doesn't make sense; I'd have preferred a stationary splitter positioned closer to one ear to prevent the wire from getting in the way or needing to adjust the plastic splitter piece. [does, make, have, preferred, positioned, prevent, getting, needing, adjust] [left, right, stationary, closer]
Tonight, because the sound kept cutting in and out on one bud, I had to walk several miles while holding the  <i> wire out in an awkward position  <i> until I finally gave up. [kept, cutting, had, walk, holding, gave] [several, awkward]
Honestly, I have not done a side-by-side with my old Sony's since I  <i> broke the wire  <i> on them, but it might be that I just aclimated to the poor sound of the jlabs (that is, they didn't really get better). [have, done, broke, be, aclimated, is, did, get] [old, poor, better]
They have a very cheap feel to them as well with very  <i> frail wire <i> . [have] [cheap, frail]
The  <i> wire are a bit short  <i> too for some scenarios. [are] [short]
If you sometimes put the player in a purse or coat pocket, you may not have  <i> enough wire length <i> . [put, have] [enough]
It picked up too much exterior noise if the wire touch anything, it's very bad for running as it hits against your clothing. [picked, touch, 's, running, hits] [much, bad]
Now the bad, the major problem with them in general from my experience of the three cheapest models is that while the buds themselves are of solid quality and relatively strong wire they are put together in a obviously cheap and rushed manner. [is, are, are, put, rushed] [bad, major, general, cheapest, solid, strong, cheap]
Because of this the wire that are connected to the actual headphone jack are held in place with a single dab of glue. [are, connected, are, held] [actual, single]
Any minor tugging on the headphones from jogging, walking or what not the  <i> wire will discount <i>  from the jack section and eventually will kill the headphones. [tugging, walking, discount, kill] [minor]
It is pretty easy to tell that the earphone itself is fine just that the  <i> wire connection has loosened  <i> and doesn't provide a solid connection anymore. [is, tell, is, has, loosened, does, provide] [easy, earphone, fine, solid]
The sound is tinny and distant, and it doesn't hold a candle to the sound in the standard issue Apple iPhone headphones, which I had to replace because the microphone on the  <i> wire stopped working <i> . [is, does, hold, had, replace, stopped, working] [tinny, distant, standard]
The other reviews about the  <i> wire being very sensitive <i>  and making a lot of noise when rubbing against you/your clothing are true - I could hear all of the rustling, bumping, etc. [being, making, rubbing, are, hear, bumping] [other, sensitive, true]
The silver in-ear portion came unglued from the black case and  <i> severed the wire <i>  leaving only one channel working. [came, severed, leaving] [in-ear, unglued, black]
The wire leading to each bud are quite thin, which makes me think that this is a fragile product. [leading, are, makes, think, is] [thin, fragile]
Update - 10-11-11: The right channel now cuts out when the  <i> wire close to the plug bends <i>  in a certain direction. [cuts, bends] [right, certain]
The two things I like about the JLabs are the case, which I use for my Skullcandy's now, and the slick wire, which doesn't seem to become tangled like other ear buds. [like, are, use, does, seem, become, tangled] [slick, other]
I could  <i> cut through the wire  <i> insulation with my fingernail, and the wire are very thin. [cut, are] [thin]
-"L", "R", symbols rub off over time -Brittle  <i> wire that freezes <i> , mine broke because of that. [rub, freezes, broke] [mine]
The  <i> wire do get tied up <i>  a little but for the price, I would say good deal. [do, get, tied, say] [little, good]
While the sound is alright but the plastic of the "buds" is really flimsy and the  <i> wire used is of cheap material <i> . [is, is, used, is] [alright, flimsy, cheap]
also if u buy it and intend to use on running - DON'T as you will hear the clicking noise caused by the  <i> wire hitting <i>  the inside of the hollow shell of the ear phones when you run and it can be louder than your music! [intend, use, running, hear, caused, hitting, run, be] [u, hollow]
The in-ear part had fallen out of the base, but it was still attached by wire. [had, fallen, was, attached] [in-ear]
One caveat:  don't be tempted to adjust the snugness of the ear bud wire under your chin, until you are sure about how far to adjust them. [do, be, tempted, adjust, are, adjust] [sure]
If you plan on jogging, you really need a snug fit so that the excess ear bud  <i> wire don't flop <i>  around transmitting unwanted vibration sound up the wire to your ears. [plan, need, do, flop, transmitting, sound] [snug, excess, unwanted]
the wire are slick instead of the iPod's slightly grippy wire, which means they untangle easier. [are, means] [slick, grippy, untangle, easier]
I've bought JBuds J1 - liked them so I bought Jbuds j2 - liked them too,  <i> wire screwed up <i>  after a year or so of active use and thus rendered the headphones useless so i figured, why not try Jbuds j3? ['ve, bought, liked, bought, liked, screwed, rendered, figured, try] [active, useless]
The earpiece needed to be glue on the first day I had them because in changing the earplug the silver part popped off (no wire snapped luckily). [needed, be, had, changing, popped, snapped] [earpiece, first]
I was thrilled with these - they fit great, sounded great (although didn't greatly reduce ambient sound) but after having them for only 3 days - one of the cords had 2 cracks in the black plastic through which I could see the silver wire underneath. [was, thrilled, fit, sounded, did, reduce, having, had, see] [great, great, ambient, black]
I thought they were going to be a good workout pair but the wire's location will constantly make noise as you move. [thought, were, going, be, make, move] [good]
The more serious earphones out there have solutions for this to go up and over your ear and have a bendy (like gumby) material to it and stay stationary away from the headphones themselves not causing any  <i> wire rubbing noise <i> . [have, go, have, stay, causing, rubbing] [more, serious, stationary]
The first impression when I got it was really good assembly quality and nice wire, however when I tried to use it impression changed immediately. [got, was, tried, use, changed] [first, good, nice]
The  <i> wire is a bit heavy <i> , which also may be a problem because of the pull on the earbuds themselves. [is, be] [heavy]
The headphones sounded great, and the wire never got all tangled up. [sounded, got, tangled] [great]
There is no exterior damage and I have always taken extra care to avoid unnecessary bends to the cord, but nevertheless, the  <i> wire inside have broken <i> . [is, have, taken, avoid, have, broken] [exterior, extra, unnecessary]
I have to  <i> wiggle/position the wire <i>  in a certain position to have sound come out of both buds (this method is starting to fail now lol). [have, wiggle\, have, come, is, starting, fail, lol] [certain, sound]
The JVCs cord is completely  <i> stripped to the wire <i> , but they are that much better. [is, stripped, are] [better]
The fit of the soft rubber plugs was good if the wire hangs straight down. [was, hangs] [soft, good]
For now, I'm going to return the JBuds and re-order the Zunes- even though I'm leery that they will develop a "hernia" again where the plastic  <i> wire starts to poke out <i>  of the cloth covering and won't go back in- that's why I was looking to replace them in the first place. ['m, going, return, 'm, develop, starts, poke, covering, go, 's, was, looking, replace] [leery, first]
The <i> wire is thin  <i> and cheap so it gets caught on my arm, not to mention the damn thing pops out of the Ipod headphone jack constantly. [is, gets, caught, mention, pops] [thin, cheap, damn]
The right channel  <i> wire loosens up  <i> inside the microphone assembly very quickly and easily. [loosens] [right]
Seems to be an issue with sub-quality conductor in the  <i> wire that breaks <i>  apart with regular usage. [Seems, be, breaks] [sub-quality, regular]
I had to buy new earplugs only a couple months after I got these, seems the  <i> wire came loose <i>  on one ear and I lost all sound. [had, buy, got, seems, came, lost] [new, couple]
The interior  <i> wire must be frayed <i> , disconnected or something. [be, frayed, disconnected] [interior]
I found i could get the sound if I held them in the exact right position at all times--no letting the wire move. [found, get, held, letting, move] [exact, right]
I don't know if it's just a  <i> loose wire  <i> or what, but they are unusable as of now. [do, know, 's, are] [loose, unusable]
The problem may be linked to the  <i> very thin wire <i>  used so my next pair of ear buds will definitely be much more substantial. [be, linked, used, be] [thin, next, substantial]
I love this style for highest comfort in the ear, but found that within a couple weeks of fairly light use,  <i> wire were showing <i>  near the end I plug into my Sansa. [love, found, were, showing, plug] [highest, light]
It was nice at first until it started falling apart, the headphones started  <i> coming out of the black wire <i>  container. [was, started, falling, started, coming] [nice, first, black]
i love the color and the length of the wire, but the buds dont really fit my ear properly they end up falling out after a few minutes, and i dont think they are too comfy. [love, fit, end, falling, think, are] [dont, few, comfy]
I think they need to make the  <i> connection of the wire <i>  to the ear bud stronger, I can hear a blip of sound if I move the wire enough, so something must have came loose inside the right ear bud. [think, need, make, hear, move, have, came] [stronger, loose, right]
There is no reason this should have happened, I am not rough with them, in fact, I've had two sets of Sony ear-buds, that still work, the ones I have don't have a long wire unless you use the adapter that is meant for the sony ericsson cell phones they came with. [is, have, happened, am, 've, had, work, have, do, have, use, is, meant, came] [rough, long, sony]
less wire turning back and forth at the junction. [turning] [less]
the  <i> wire are very thin <i>  and not reinforced anywhere. [are, reinforced] [thin]
I was happy until one bud quit working and I found that basically electrical connectivity was  <i> lost where the wire  <i> joins to the jack. [was, quit, working, found, was, lost, joins] [happy, electrical]
I tell you, I have worn out many headphones and earbuds(many brands) and always it is where the jack is attached to the wire, so I guess that Jlabs is not really too different from anybody else in the cheap earbud market. [tell, have, is, is, attached, guess, is] [worn, many, many, different, cheap, earbud]
I kept using them, though, because I find it amusing that I am jamming a broken ear bud with  <i> exposed wire <i>  into my left ear. [kept, using, find, am, jamming, exposed, left] [amusing, broken]
So basically the left ear bud, with its  <i> exposed wire <i> , still sounds fine so at least I can get by with one ear's worth of audio until I buy something else. [left, exposed, sounds, get, buy] [fine, least]
Another note, and this maybe be true of all in-ear earbuds, is any  <i> movement to the wire <i>  will be translated to noise in your ears. [be, is, be, translated] [true, in-ear]
However, that love was short lived when the silver housing of the wire harness on the right earbud would not stay secured within its housing. [was, lived, stay, secured] [short, right]
The product does have some strength, such as the quality of the wire, and the case that comes with it. [does, have, comes] [such]
This one is better than skull candy for working out-the noise from the  <i> wire moving isn't as bad <i> . [is, working, moving, is] [better, out-the, bad]
Unfortunately, that results in the stick and wire coming out at a 90 degree angle to the head - quite funny looking, and not good at all if you want to put on hearing protection over them. [coming, looking, want, put] [funny, good]
I love the sound quality and bass in these, but one of the  <i> wire(which are too long) frayed <i>  at the part that joins the earpiece. [love, are, frayed, joins] [sound, long]
I will think about buying these again, but the  <i> wire should be shorter <i>  and stronger where they join the earbuds. [think, buying, be, join] [shorter, stronger]
These are great earbuds, but i am giving it 3 stars because the  <i> wire came loose <i>  in on the left side and now there is no sound in that ear bud. [are, am, giving, came, is] [great, left]
I'm not sure if this is an issue with the driver or if the  <i> wire started getting loose <i>  from use but I contacted the company through their website and requested a warranty repair. ['m, is, started, getting, contacted, requested] [sure, loose]
the day came that the sound in the left ear started intermittently going out--an internal  <i> wire came loose <i> , I'm not sure--which pretty much rendered them unusable. [came, started, going, came, 'm, rendered] [left, internal, sure, unusable]
These earbuds lasted only about 7 months before the  <i> wire started separating  <i> and one earbud lost sound. [lasted, started, separating, lost] [earbud]
The  <i> wire is very thin <i> ; too thin to last. [is, last] [thin, thin]
Everyday i would unwrap the wire from around my ipod, place the ipod in my back pocket, and go to work (never sat on it). [unwrap, place, go, work, sat] [Everyday, back]
It was pretty clear that a  <i> wire had either broken <i>  in the earbuds near the plug or maybe come loose from its solder. [was, had, broken, come] [clear]
They died from what appeared to be a broken wire in the same place. [died, appeared, be] [broken, same]
if I hold the wire just right, the right side will work. [hold, work] [right]
My theory is that the  <i> wire inside the insulation broke <i>  and when they connect you hear a little bit of whats playing. [is, broke, connect, hear, playing] [little]
However, after a week the right bud started coming apart and the  <i> wire became exposed <i> . [started, coming, became, exposed] [right]
The  <i> wire tore <i>  just above the plug, apparently because I had wrapped them around my mp3 player. [tore, had, wrapped] [mp3]
As has been stated before, apparently the <i>  wire quality is not as high <i>  as it might seem. [has, been, stated, is, seem] [high]
The  <i> wire split <i>  and at first I could only hear out of one side and then that stopped working, too. [hear, stopped, working] [first]
When I wiggled the jack and held the wire a certain way, and remained still, it worked fine. [wiggled, held, remained, worked] [certain]
The sound quality is OK to decent, but the  <i> wire are dental floss thin <i>  - working out (at least cardio workouts) while wearing these is an exercise in frustration. [is, are, working, wearing, is] [sound, OK, decent, dental, thin, least]
From the spot where the  <i> wire splits <i>  to the point where they connect to each ear bud the wire are very thin. [splits, connect, are] [thin]
17, 2010), and while on vacation (now) the left bud popped out of the black case which it is held, like on the close up there is a sliver part (metal) and the black case thing that is connected to the wire, the silver and the  <i> wire part separated <i> . [left, popped, is, held, is, is, connected, separated] [black, black]
The wire are too long and get tangled. [are, get, tangled] [long]
Smooth coating on the wire reduces rubbing noises. [reduces, rubbing] [Smooth]
After a few months of general use, the  <i> wire became loose  <i> at the plastic split causing disruption to the sound. [became, causing] [few, general, loose, plastic]
My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack. [is, DID, appear, cuts, hold] [visual, fine, right, specific]
After a few months, the  <i> wire seems broken <i> inside. [seems] [few, broken]
You have to put the wire in a specific position to make it work. [have, put, make, work] [specific]
Although, I think my problem is with the  <i> durability of the wire  <i> as right now, only one side works and the quality of sound on the other has deteriorated dramatically. [think, is, has, deteriorated] [other]
The J2s were so incredible because they eliminated the problem that plagues so many in-ear headphones - that sound you hear when the wire taps your desk, the treadmill, or anything else. [were, eliminated, plagues, hear] [incredible, many, in-ear]
After two months the sound only comes out of one earbud unless you wiggle the wire the exact correct way and don't move it. [comes, wiggle, do, move] [exact, correct]
