If you turn the music off completely and then just listens to the noise created by moving your head you will see what I mean -- it is especially bad when wearing a jacket as the cord/wires rub across the collar constantly. [turn, listens, created, moving, see, mean, is, wearing] [bad]
Today, after a little over five months of use (undoubtedly the shortest period a set of ear buds have lasted me)the sound on the left ear bud gave out, not due to wear and tear where the cord meets the ear bud, but what is apparently invisible  <i> damage where the cord meets the audio jack <i> . [have, lasted, left, gave, wear, tear, meets, is, meets] [little, shortest, due, invisible, audio]
I can tell because with some  <i> fiddling at the audio jack <i> , the sound gets restored momentarily only to be lost with the slightest bit of movement. [tell, gets, restored, be, lost] [audio, slightest]
I think the ultimate cause of the failure in my case is that the audio  <i> jack itself is not designed  <i> as an L-shaped plug (which in my opinion, reduces the chances for damage during storage). [think, is, is, designed, reduces] [ultimate, audio, L-shaped]
The straight audio  <i> jack awkwardly sticks <i>  out from whatever device you use, making it more likely that it could get damaged by any little thing that may press up against the audio jack and cable. [sticks, use, making, get, damaged, press] [straight, likely, little, audio]
5 mm jack housing is constructed at a 45degree angle different than typical L looking jack. [is, constructed, looking] [45degree, different, typical]
The input connector of the headphones seems to be the weakest hardware aspect as I found them to be scratchy if the body behind the  <i> jack is bent <i>  in anyway. [seems, be, found, be, is] [weakest, scratchy, bent]
Gold connector jack, Price Cons: Ear buds pop out extremely easily, muted sounds not much high treble or bass feeling,. [pop] [muted, high]
If I  <i> fiddle with the wire near the jack <i>  I can occasionally get sound to come out but no permanent fix. [get, sound, come] [permanent]
But soon after that I noticed that there was something  <i> wrong with the jack  <i> end of the headphones. [noticed, was] [wrong]
And it's not just my ipod - the headphones have the same problem when plugged into any headphone jack. ['s, have, plugged] [same]
About a week later, neither of the buds would work except if you moved around the wire near the audio jack. [work, moved] [audio]
The gold coating on the input piece had chipped off, and you'd have to get it at just the right angle in the jack to hear out of both sides. [had, chipped, have, get, hear] [right]
Then both buds stopped and sound could only be coaxed out of the pair by  <i> adjusting the jack <i>  around the iPod in a specific position, but would fade in and out. [stopped, sound, be, coaxed, adjusting, fade] [specific]
There's some sweet spot near the  <i> jack that causes my iPod to pause <i>  whenever I hit it (accidentally). ['s, causes, pause, hit] [sweet]
The cable itself seems like it is sturdy but I am concerned about the  <i> durability of the headphone jack <i> . [seems, is, am, concerned] [sturdy]
Wire Connection on  <i> jack dodgy <i>  and no longer provides consistent sound. [provides] [consistent]
They seem like fine earbuds, but the plug doesn't fit into the recessed 1st gen iphone jack, which is what I bought them for. [seem, does, fit, recessed, is, bought] [fine]
The  <i> problem appears to be in the jack <i> , which is not a 90 degree or straight, but an annoying 45 degree angle. [appears, be, is] [annoying]
Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds. [wrap, started, show, stopped, put, listened, got, hear] [durable, worse]
Anyway, the little rubber things fall off too easy, and I have just had to replace them because the wire has a  <i> short in it right where the jack <i>  goes into the ipod, and sound only comes out of one side unless you hold the cord steady. [fall, have, had, replace, has, goes, sound, comes, hold] [little, easy, short, steady]
Only way I can get the sound to work is by bending the cable above the jack slightly in one direction, but once I release the cable the sound cuts out once more on the right side. [get, work, is, bending, release] [sound, more, right]
This is a common problem with earbuds with a classic jack connection. [is] [common, classic]
After about 4-6 months of daily use, some connection around the  <i> jack comes loose <i>  and one of the earphones cuts in and out, eventually cutting out completely. [comes, cutting] [daily]
I can get it to come on again if I hold the lead at a certain angle with respect to the jack, but it will cut out again and I have to find a new angle. [get, come, hold, cut, have, find] [certain, new]
If you use earphones daily get more expensive ones with the hard plastic jack housing. [use, get] [daily, expensive, hard]
great sound and easy to use, but I only used these for about 5 months and they no longer work - seems to be the  <i> cable connection to the jack <i> . [use, used, work, seems, be] [great, easy]
5mm  <i> jack - something appears to have become loose <i>  in that area. [appears, have, become] [5mm, loose]
By "broke" I am referring to whenever I  <i> tough the headphone jack <i> , even if it is the slightest touch (sometimes I don't need to touch it at all), the left or right speaker goes out. [broke, am, referring, is, do, need, touch, goes] [tough, slightest, right]
It was possible to achieve intermittent activity when I took the cable and pressed it gently where it meets the neck of the jack, but I wasn't going to put up with that. [was, achieve, took, pressed, meets, was, going, put] [possible, intermittent]
5 mm headphone jack and I get shocked every time I use these earbuds, even if I don't touch anything; I tried using friends' earbuds, no shocking ensued. [get, shocked, use, do, touch, tried, using, ensued] [shocking]
The only advantage is the price and nice L-shaped connection jack. [is] [only, nice, L-shaped]
BUT, after 5 weeks, I lost one channel when the wiring went  <i> bad at the jack  <i> end. [lost, went] [bad]
The stiff piece meant to protect the wiring was so inflexible that it ended up pulling the  <i> connection loose at the jack <i> . [meant, protect, was, ended, pulling] [stiff, inflexible]
Something else I didn't think about when I purchased these was the shape of audio jack--it's a elbow unlike the straight connection used by the Apple ear buds. [did, think, purchased, was, 's, used] [audio, straight]
I just wish they used the angled jack, those jack seem to hold up a lot better. [wish, used, seem, hold] [angled, better]
I can only hear out of it if I move the jack around a lot and find a good spot, so it's become extremely annoying to walk around with these on because when I move, the  <i> jack moves <i>  and the sound in the one ear is sporadic. [hear, move, find, 's, become, annoying, walk, move, is] [good, sporadic]
This is a common problem for people that carry their headphones/ipod in their pockets constantly, so I'd be careful, and would instead get headphones with angled connecting jack like the new VModa's. [is, carry, be, get, connecting] [common, careful, angled, new]
Despite "breaking in" the buds magnets by leaving them attached to the stereo jack on my tuner for 24hr. [breaking, leaving, attached] [24hr]
The  <i> sound is muted or crackles if the jack  <i> is wiggled or "bumped". [is, is, wiggled, bumped] [muted]
Then the  <i> jack starts to wear <i>  out and either one bud cuts out, or the sound wobbles back and forth, etc. [starts, wear, cuts] [sound]
I  <i> tried twisting the jack <i>  around in the headphone port on my laptop, because that used to work with my old, non-JLab headphones, but it didn't do anything. [tried, twisting, used, work, did, do] [old, non-JLab]
5mm audio  <i> jack is where the problem is <i> . [is, is] [5mm, audio]
I would have thought JLab would have reinforced where the cable cord meets the audio jack. [have, thought, have, reinforced, meets] [audio]
The wires must have come  <i> loose near the audio jack  <i> because whenever I move them a certain way I will get sound (however it doesn't stay working). [have, come, move, get, does, stay, working] [audio, certain, sound]
At first, if  <i> I wiggled the jack  <i> or held the wire a certain way, and remained perfectly still, it'd come back but only go out again. [wiggled, held, remained, come, go] [certain]
However, after almost a 18 months of usage, one of the buds went silent as apparently some of the smaller wires inside the casing leading to the  <i> jack became detached <i>  at the base of the plug. [went, casing, leading, became, detached] [silent, smaller]
Great sound, however, the bulkiness at the end of the 1/8th  <i> jack makes it impossible to fit <i>  securely into clip ons that are designed for the Nano. [makes, fit, are, designed] [1\, impossible]
The headphone  <i> jack is flimsy <i>  and falls to pieces almost immediately. [is, falls] [flimsy]
5mm jack is very durable. [is] [5mm, durable]
5mm  <i> jack also isn't right-angled <i> , which increases wear and tear on the cable. [is, increases, tear] [5mm, right-angled]
Now, I need to  <i> hold the headphone jack  <i> to a certain position in order to get a sound. [need, hold, get] [certain]
Today the left bud started shorting out when the  <i> jack wasn't positioned <i>  just right. [started, shorting, was, positioned] [left]
Because of this the wires that are connected to the actual headphone jack are held in place with a single dab of glue. [are, connected, are, held] [actual, single]
Any minor tugging on the headphones from jogging, walking or what not the wires will discount from the jack section and eventually will kill the headphones. [tugging, walking, discount, kill] [minor]
Also the <i>  jack is hard to pull <i>  full the socket since the exterior is smooth, so it makes it difficult to pull out of the headphone slot. [is, pull, is, makes, pull] [hard, full, smooth, difficult]
) The mini jack is at a right angle which makes it a nice fit on the Sansa Clip. [is, makes] [right, nice]
Not only is the sound quality different, but the earphone jack and cord are different which leads me to believe that I either received a knock-off version of this product or perhaps they changed the model slightly. [is, are, leads, believe, received, changed] [sound, different, earphone, different, knock-off]
5mm  <i> jack is terrible <i>  and will break causing audio loss. [is, break, causing] [5mm, terrible, audio]
Straight-in jack - This is a ruined pair of ear phones waiting to happen. [is, ruined, waiting, happen] [Straight-in]
I use my mp3 player almost exclusively for exercising, and even though I use a clip to secure the headphone cord to my jacket or shirt (to eliminate the tendency of the cord to pull the buds out of my ears), I often find that the buds eventually start to get loose and I need to push them back in, or they get sweaty and I need to dry them off. [use, exercising, use, secure, eliminate, pull, find, start, get, need, push, get, need, dry] [mp3, loose, sweaty]
This caused stress on the wiring near the end of the headphones (where they plug in to a jack), resulting in intermittent connections. [caused, plug, resulting] [intermittent]
Second of all, the headphone  <i> jack is too sensitive <i>  with my itouch. [is] [sensitive]
if i touch the tip of the  <i> jack the sound goes out to muffled <i>  to loud to soft etc. [touch, goes, muffled] [loud, soft]
I constantly had to  <i> play with the jack <i>  to get the sound right, and by the time i place it back into my pocket the sound is all messed up again. [had, play, get, is, messed] [sound]
I take really good care of my electronic products, wrapping headphones carefully and taking out the jack whenever I'm not using it but still these headphones break on me! [take, wrapping, taking, 'm, using, break] [good, electronic]
So i had to use the nifty one year warranty from jlab and when i got my replacement headphones they worked like a charm for a few months for me but then head phones  <i> jack broke off <i>  inside of my iPod i don't know if this is common problem or not but i would recommend these headphones if you don't mind taking a risk. [had, use, got, worked, jack, broke, do, know, is, recommend, do, mind, taking] [nifty, few, common]
The wire is thin and cheap so it gets caught on my arm, not to mention the damn thing  <i> pops out of the Ipod headphone jack <i>  constantly. [is, gets, caught, mention, pops] [thin, cheap, damn]
That being said, i only had these earbuds for a few months before the cord  <i> broke near the jack <i> . [being, said, had, broke] [few]
My best diagnosis is that the wiring is  <i> disconnecting from the jack  <i> inside the casing. [is, is, disconnecting] [best]
i think (have no proof) that angled connectors work better and last longer if your player has the jack port on the side. [think, have, angled, work, has] [better, last]
I was happy until one bud quit working and I found that basically electrical connectivity was  <i> lost where the wire joins to the jack <i> . [was, quit, working, found, was, lost, joins] [happy, electrical]
I tell you, I have worn out many headphones and earbuds(many brands) and always it is where the jack is attached to the wire, so I guess that Jlabs is not really too different from anybody else in the cheap earbud market. [tell, have, is, is, attached, guess, is] [worn, many, many, different, cheap, earbud]
and if you pull the jack out a little ways, you can hear them fine. [pull, hear] [little, fine]
but if you are a runner or even walking with this jack out a little ways, it falls right out. [are, walking, falls] [little]
If I moved the cord around it would come in and out but it never stayed on consistently - flashback to when you try to get the sound for a movie in an airplane using your own headphones and you struggle trying to get the jack to go in just the right amount to get sound in both ears. [moved, come, stayed, try, get, using, struggle, trying, get, go, get] [own, right, sound]
I've pinpointed the  <i> issue to the jack <i>  end of the chord, which in inexcusable. ['ve, pinpointed] [inexcusable]
The part of the headphones that plugs into a  <i> jack/phone outlet is deteriorated <i>  to the point that it does not fit anymore. [plugs, is, deteriorated, does, fit] [jack\]
first I thought it was the earbug itself then I found out it  <i> was the jack <i> . [thought, was, found, was] [earbug]
When I wiggled the jack and held the wire a certain way, and remained still, it worked fine. [wiggled, held, remained, worked] [certain]
Either way, they only lasted four months and ended up breaking in two ways- the earbud fell out of one side, and the  <i> jack connecting to my iPod came loose <i> , so you'd always have to fiddle with the jack, which is very irritating. [lasted, ended, breaking, fell, connecting, came, have, is] [irritating]
I use these mostly for jogging, but do carry them wrapped around my Sansa Clip in my jeans pocket, and apparently this is too much for the non-reinforced portion at the back end of the pin jack. [use, do, carry, wrapped, is] [much, non-reinforced, back]
My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack. [is, DID, appear, cuts, hold] [visual, fine, right, specific]
When I put the plug into my iPod if I even slightly twist the plug while it is in the  <i> jack I will get a lot of static <i> . [put, twist, is, get] [static]
The  <i> problem is inside the headphone jack  <i> somewhere, though there is no apparent damage to the outside. [is, is] [apparent]
