Unfortunately, I am sending them back for 2 different reasons: (1) When wearing the earbuds the  <i> cord/wires somehow "create" noise <i>  that interferes with your music listening. [am, sending, wearing, create, interferes, listening] [different]
If you turn the music off completely and then just listens to the noise created by moving your head you will see what I mean -- it is especially bad when wearing a jacket as the  <i> cord/wires rub across the collar <i>  constantly. [turn, listens, created, moving, see, mean, is, wearing] [bad]
I am about 6 feet tall and the <i> cord is so short <i> that I cannot wear the earbuds and put my MP3 player in a cargo short pocket, or even in the front pocket of a pair of gym pants. [am, is, wear, put] [tall, short, MP3, short, front]
Good sound, but despite being really  <i> careful with the cord <i> , the right earbud died prematurely. [being, died] [Good, careful, right]
when one bud is dangling and I am on a call I hear/feel every movement the free bud makes as well as the  <i> cord rubbing against my shirt <i> . [is, dangling, am, hear\, makes, rubbing] [free]
Second pain point is the shorter overall length of the cord - and honestly this comes down to personal preference I know. [is, comes, know] [Second, shorter, overall, personal]
it's too short and the grippy material used for the  <i> cord catches on my steering wheel <i> . ['s, used, catches, steering] [short, grippy]
I do like the construction of the cord though, looks great and seems durable. [do, looks, seems] [great, durable]
No special instruction like this product requires "twist headphone upside down to your ear canal and put the cord around your ears" for when you exercise. [requires, put, exercise] [special]
The <i> cord is too short <i> and moving the cord makes a rustling sound in the ear. [is, moving, makes] [short]
The <i> cord is also very cheap <i> - again, you get what you pay for, but I really expected more. [is, get, pay, expected] [cheap]
The left and right pieces are almost connected to eachother at first, so you have to  <i> rip the cord  <i> to give a gap between the left and right pieces so you can put them on. [are, connected, eachother, have, rip, give, put] [right, right]
I can easily see myself  <i> ripping the cord  <i> accidentally in the future, thus creating a bigger gap and a huge mess along with that. [see, ripping, creating] [bigger, huge]
But I knocked off an extra star, because of the way the <i> cord rips <i> . [knocked, rips] [extra]
These earphones come with a very rigid cord that I thought it was good and durable, but it does not bend too easy and when it rubs against your clothes you can hear it amplified. [come, thought, was, does, bend, rubs, hear, amplified] [rigid, good, durable, easy]
The cord is perfect, it doesn't get easily tangled and it's got a good sturdy feel to it. [is, does, get, tangled, 's, got] [perfect, good, sturdy]
However, the real issue comes from the  <i> noise that the cord  <i> makes when it brushes against something such as clothing. [comes, makes] [real, such]
I called the company and they told me that due to my jogging the excess  <i> stress on the cord  <i> (bumping up and down)and the excess moisture (the sweat in my ears) were user made damages and thus cannot be covered and apologize for such a short lifespan. [called, told, bumping, were, made, be, covered, apologize] [due, excess, excess, short]
Pros: Solid construction Cord does not tangle easily (and perfect length) Lightweight Comfortable Attractive Case is Awesome Blocks out ambient sound well (when in ear*) Clear crisp mid & high range Cons: Bumps or taps transports  <i> sound through cord  <i> - Think of a doctor's stethoscope. [does, tangle, is, sound, Think] [Solid, perfect, Awesome, ambient, Clear, crisp, high]
I use them at the gym primarily, and working out is OK - but doing cardio, I have to snake it down my back, under my t-shirt, cord held down by my cardio monitor strap to minimize the sounds of the  <i> cord / wire bumping  <i> my t-shirt when moving! [use, working, is, doing, have, held, minimize, bumping, moving] [OK]
At least it's not the funky cord style like the sony fontopias. ['s] [least, funky, sony]
within a week after that, the other headphone didn't work (unless I twisted the cord in just the right way). [did, twisted] [other, right]
The cord length is 6-12 inches to short in my opinion. [is] [short]
the <i> cord is too short <i> the the headphone keep give you shock while you are moving or doing anything. [is, keep, give, are, moving, doing] [short]
Worse than that, I had failed to take advantage of the warranty while I could and Amazon had no record of me even buying them, which made no sense. [had, failed, take, had, buying, made] [Worse]
Also the <i> cord is very short <i> but i am very impressed seeeming it is impossible to tangle unless you practicallt tie it in a knot. [is, am, seeeming, is, tangle, practicallt, tie] [short, impressed, impossible]
I've gone through a lot of ear buds and they usually end up needing replacing after one side or the other loses sound due to wear and  <i> tear wear the cord  <i> meets the ear buds. ['ve, gone, end, needing, replacing, loses, wear, tear, wear, meets] [other, sound, due]
Today, after a little over five months of use (undoubtedly the shortest period a set of ear buds have lasted me)the sound on the left ear bud gave out, not due to  <i> wear and tear where the cord  <i> meets the ear bud, but what is apparently invisible  <i> damage where the cord <i>  meets the audio jack. [have, lasted, left, gave, wear, tear, meets, is, meets] [little, shortest, due, invisible, audio]
The <i> cord are pretty stiff <i> and the ear buds are actually quite hard. [are, are] [stiff, hard]
I also like the fact that the cord is a very nice size, and i like the Y-shape of the cord because it looks "cooler" in my opinion. [is, looks] [nice]
There is of course the infamous  <i> cord problem  <i> where you hear it like a stethoscope but many of the models out there have the same problem and theres not much you can do about it besides buy a different pair. [is, hear, have, theres, do, buy] [infamous, many, same, much, different]
If the  <i> cord bounces <i>  on your body at all, there is horrible feedback into the sound stream. [is] [horrible, sound]
Then with wear and tear, the right earbud started to go, and I would have to fight and twist the cord to get a half-second of sound. [tear, started, go, have, fight, twist, get] [right]
The cord was a good length, and there was some reduction in outside noise. [was, was] [good, outside]
The Skullcandy cord is also a lot thicker and sturdier than the JBuds cord. [is] [thicker, sturdier]
If for some reason you don't want to pay an extra few dollars, though, the JBuds are good - just be really careful with the cord. [do, want, pay, are, be] [extra, few, good, careful]
The ear buds are extremely prone to popping out of your ear canal if the cord is at all moved; which was not my case with the stock iPod ear buds. [are, popping, is, moved, was] [prone]
The  <i> cord was stiff and heavy <i>  so the earbuds did not stay in my ears at all. [was, did, stay] [stiff, heavy]
comfort great, but the  <i> cord was too long <i> , and it did not have a good solid cord. [was, did, have] [great, good, solid]
Buds are hard to get in the ear and the <i> cord is flimsy <i> and too short. [are, get, is] [hard, flimsy, short]
I had a bad habit of wrapping the cord around my MP3 player, so I'm not ready to blame JLab for that. [had, wrapping, 'm, blame] [bad, ready]
This is painful and transmits every <i>  cord rattle  <i> right to my eardrums. [is, rattle] [painful]
I ordered new ones, because my warranty had run up and the new headphones wouldn't work properly unless I had the cord positioned just right in my mp3 player. [ordered, had, run, work, had, positioned] [new, new, mp3]
The problem however is that the  <i> length of the cord <i>  when they split to each earpiece is too short. [is, split, is] [short]
The company recomends looping the cord around the ears which is completely impossible. [recomends, looping, is] [impossible]
The first issue I have is that I am a tall man (6' 2") and find the cord to be about 4 inches shorter than I would like it to be. [have, is, am, find, be, like, be] [first, tall, shorter]
As a few other reviewers have noted, I too encountered the problem where one of the buds (in my case, the left) stopped working after only a couple months of use (even though it would sometimes come on intermittently, if the cord was moved correctly, I don't think it should be considered "working" when you can't stick your iPod in your pocket while you're walking aroung and expect it to work consistently). [have, noted, encountered, stopped, working, come, was, moved, do, think, be, considered, working, stick, 're, walking, expect, work] [few, other, couple]
also, the <i> cord is very very short <i> . [is] [short]
It hasn't even been 2 months yet, and the  <i> cord has failed <i> -  I can only get sound out of one side; the other being intermittent (primarily off) as I flex the cord near the insertion to the plug. [has, been, has, failed, get, sound, being, flex] [other, intermittent]
To be fair, there are a lot of variables involved in the durability rating that I have given: perhaps my pocket is a harsher environment that what was intended for these headphones; perhaps I unknowingly yanked the cord at some point. [be, are, involved, have, given, is, was, intended, yanked] [fair, harsher]
I seriously do not like how  <i> short the actual cord <i>  is, also the ear buds aren't as far apart as the old pair I had. [do, like, is, are, had] [short, actual, old]
That is, if the cord touches something, there is an audible sound in the headphones that simply is not exhibited with most other headphones. [is, is, is, exhibited] [audible, most, other]
I bought a pair of the J2's last year and they were great until the cord got pulled out of one of the ear-pieces. [bought, were, got, pulled] [last, great]
When I stretch them almost to the full extent that the cord is straight they intermittently send a shock to my ears. [stretch, is, send] [full]
The cord is especially nice - it seems to be Teflon-coated and is very soft with a bit of memory character. [is, seems, be, is] [nice, Teflon-coated, soft]
A good fit and seal are very easy to achieve either cord-up or cord-down. [are, achieve] [good, easy, cord-up, cord-down]
Now the fatal flaw:  Even though the sound seems better than it was out of the box, if anything touches the cord even slightly along its entire length, the sound is amplified in the earphones. [seems, was, is, amplified] [fatal, better, entire]
You have to isolate and  <i> immobilize the cord  <i> not to have the otherwise good sound quality destroyed by the rumbling that seems ever-present. [have, isolate, immobilize, have, destroyed, rumbling, seems] [good, sound, ever-present]
If the cord even grazes your shirt, hand, desk or any other object your audio will be spoiled by the <i>  cord rustling <i> . [grazes, be, spoiled] [other]
The headset is worthless; you can hear every sound amplified when you touch the cord; it sounds like I'm wearing a stethoscope to listen to music; every breath I take touches the cord and I hear a rumble along the line; even cheap earphones that I buy from a street vendor for $5 don't do that. [is, hear, amplified, touch, sounds, 'm, wearing, listen, take, hear, rumble, buy, do, do] [worthless, cheap]
The non tangle cord was great as well. [was] [great]
Cons: Honestly, bad sound (I mean really bad in my experience) bad wiring ( <i> crackles if you move the cord <i>  esp. [mean, move] [bad, bad, bad]
However, after 3 days of occasional use with my laptop, the left earbud stopped working unless I wiggled the cord and held it just right. [left, stopped, working, wiggled, held] [occasional]
I've previously owned the standard Apple (good sound, but let in too much environmental noise), Sony (good sound & very comfortable, but the cord turned to mush w/in 2 months), and a cheap brand whose buds felt like they were made from a old tire. ['ve, owned, let, turned, mush, felt, were, made] [standard, good, much, environmental, good, comfortable, w\, cheap, old]
JBuds have three sizes to choose from to find a comfortable fit, sound is adequate, noted  <i> distortion from cord <i>  rubbing on cloths with active movement. [have, choose, find, is, noted, rubbing] [comfortable, adequate, active]
I love the JBuds J1, except for the mechanical flaws ( <i> poor cord relief <i> , uncomfortable plastic arm on bud, etc), but the sound quality was excellent. [love, was] [mechanical, poor, uncomfortable, sound, excellent]
When my J1's finally gave up (due to my rough treatment, and the poor  <i> cord strain relief <i> ) I quickly purchased two of the J3's. [gave, purchased] [due, rough, poor]
Good cord strain relief, and MUCH better comfort when laying down. [laying] [Good, better]
Even the cord is of much higher quality. [is] [higher]
The <i> cord is to short <i> . [is] [short]
If the  <i> cord get bent <i>  a certain way it stops being registered by the Ipod player. [get, stops, being, registered] [bent, certain]
Also think that the  <i> cord is crazy long  <i> making it a bit of a nuisance at times. [think, is, making] [crazy]
Additionally, it's very difficult to talk and exercise in these as every time you  <i> bump the cord  <i> against your body or scratch as the microphone or inline controls, there is a loud echo in your ear. ['s, talk, exercise, bump, is, echo] [difficult, loud]
Pros: Looks good Good fit in ear Perfect cord length Mic works well Bass isn't bad Con: Treble is screweddddd (this con basically outweighs all the other pros for me). [Looks, works, is, is, screweddddd, outweighs] [good, Good, bad, other]
 <i> Wiggling the cord <i>  gently also caused the sound in the other earbud to go in and out. [Wiggling, caused, go] [other]
But the  <i> cord noise <i>  bothers me too much whenever you move. [move] [much]
I listen to music very quietly though, so if you had the volume higher it would probably drown out the cord noise. [listen, had, drown] [higher]
The <i> cord is somewhat flimsy <i> and cheap feeling. [is] [flimsy, cheap]
There is no sliding cord-keeper piece, which helps to keep them untangled. [is, sliding, helps, keep] [cord-keeper, untangled]
This, coupled with the thin and plastic-y feel of the  <i> cord makes them tangle <i>  a lot. [coupled, makes, tangle] [thin, plastic-y]
The left speaker turns off and on randomly, and you have to twist and play with the cord to get the sound back. [turns, have, twist, play, get] [left]
And the <i> cord is pretty short <i> . [is] [short]
I do like that the cord doesn't tangle, the sound quality is good and the carrying case keeps everything clean and in order. [do, does, tangle, is, carrying, keeps] [sound, good, clean]
Even when just walking the line  <i> noise is unbearable if the cord <i>  so much as even touches my shirt, which makes it very difficult to run with. [walking, is, makes, run] [unbearable, difficult]
The fit is comfortable for me, and the weight and cord have not been a problem. [is, have, been] [comfortable]
The bad news is the cord is about 6" shorter than the unextended length of the Maximo's. [is, is] [bad, shorter, unextended]
The cord is of moderate length, but the earbuds just simply won't stay in when you're sweating and moving. [is, stay, 're, moving] [moderate]
Any type of  <i> contact with the cord <i>  with or without the sound on is loudly audible. [is] [audible]
This includes so much as  <i> rubbing the cord  <i> slightly, or even breathing on it. [includes, rubbing, breathing] [much]
Edit: It was windy outside today and the noise it made by hitting the cord for these headphones was louder than the music I was listening to. [was, made, hitting, was, was, listening] [windy]
Edit #2: While the issue with  <i> bumping the cord <i>  still exists, the sound quality has greatly improved over time. [bumping, exists, has, improved] [sound]
It is uncomfortable, the <i> cord is shorter <i> than most, and the sound quality is mediocre at best. [is, is, is] [uncomfortable, shorter, most, sound, mediocre, best]
And while I knew the  <i> cord was a bit shorter  <i> than what I wanted and was used to, they still ended up being too short for ease of use. [knew, was, wanted, was, used, ended, being] [shorter, short]
you hear every move you make as the cord bounces on your body, the <i> cord is too short <i> so you cant run with them the earbuds fall out of your ears easily so again you cant run with them. [hear, make, is, cant, run, fall] [short, cant]
The <i> cord is short <i> but other than that they are worth the money as the sound quality and fit are both good. [is, are, are] [short, other, worth, sound, good]
The <i> cord is VERY short <i> . [is] [short]
The <i> cord is significantly shorter <i> than the usual ones. [is] [shorter, usual]
My main fault with these, which is probably my own fault for not buying the correct item, is that the  <i> cord is too long <i>  for use with an arm band. [is, buying, is, is] [main, own, correct, long]
I was buying these to replace ear buds that had a shorter left ear cord than right ear cord with a 2ft cable extension for regular listening. [was, buying, replace, had, left] [shorter, right, 2ft, regular]
After having that feature and using them all the time at the gym, I decided I couldn't live with this long cord in the JBuds and needed to return them. [having, using, decided, live, needed, return] [long]
They also kept coming out of my ears due to that  <i> cord flapping <i>  everywhere. [kept, coming, flapping] [due]
JBuds, you should look into creating ear buds like I just described above (one ear  <i> cord shorter than the other <i>  with extension cable) for people who like to use arm bands at the gym. [look, creating, described, like, use] [shorter, other]
I really just wanted a pair of earphones that when I walked/jogged I wouldn't get the annoying noise through the cord. [wanted, walked\, get] [annoying]
I had been searching for the best earphones I could get at a good price and have a long cord so I wouldn't have to worry about them always pulling out of my ears. [had, been, searching, get, have, have, worry, pulling] [best, good, long]
Ordered them and noticed the cord was longer and they fit even more perfectly. [Ordered, noticed, was, fit] [longer]
They made the  <i> cord shorter <i>  and didn't fit as well as the previous. [made, did, fit] [shorter, previous]
So now back to square one with the horrible JBuds 3 that constantly fall out of my ear on top of the already short cord. [square, fall] [horrible, short]
And, last but not least, the rubber cord wrap where the wire and the plug meets is already showing signs of cracking -- which I'm sure is only an indicator of the overall build quality of these "quality" headphones. [meets, is, showing, cracking, 'm, is, build] [last, least, sure, overall]
After a few weeks the left side went out, if i jiggled the cord it would sometimes phase back in, then the right side went out. [went, jiggled, phase, went] [few, left, right]
The metal finish and the cord and everything looks absolutely stunning. [looks] [stunning]
They do feel pretty flimsy so I'm trying to take care not to yank the  <i> cord which is pretty short <i> . [do, feel, 'm, trying, take, yank, is] [flimsy, short]
The <i> cord is on the short side <i> ; I'm 5' 4" and prefer to keep my iPod in my pocket while working out. [is, 'm, prefer, keep, working] [short]
I believe the <i> cord is too thin <i> to cause this problem. [believe, is, cause] [thin]
- The  <i> cord material is quite think <i>  and heavy. [is, think] [heavy]
It's more like a wire than a normal headphone cord. ['s] [more, normal]
Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds. [wrap, started, show, stopped, put, listened, got, hear] [durable, worse]
But with the J3Ms, I already know the track record might mean I don't even get a few months of sound out of one ear. [know, mean, do, get] [few]
Anyway, the little rubber things fall off too easy, and I have just had to replace them because the wire has a short in it right where the jack goes into the ipod, and sound only comes out of one side unless you hold the cord steady. [fall, have, had, replace, has, goes, sound, comes, hold] [little, easy, short, steady]
probably my sons fault because he wraps the cord around the ipod to put into his pocket and I'm sure they probably tell you not to do that. [wraps, put, 'm, tell, do] [sure]
Bottom line is, for the money they are pretty good over all, but word to the wise, don't wrap the cord around your mp3 player if you can help it or they might not last too long. [is, are, do, wrap, help, last] [good, wise, mp3]
The cable is thick, the construction high quality, and the sound is like I'm sitting in the recording studio. [is, is, 'm, sitting] [thick, high]
When I first saw them, I was very pleased; the cord has a nice feel and the case is very convenient with the pouch that hold different earbud sizes. [saw, was, has, is, hold] [pleased, nice, convenient, different, earbud]
I've had many pairs of earbuds and do understand that the movement of the cord will be picked up by your ears when you're not listening to music, but this crinkling sound (I think from faulty manufacturing) drove me nuts and actually hurt my ears. ['ve, had, do, understand, be, picked, 're, listening, think, drove, hurt] [many, crinkling, faulty]
Considering that the wiring isn't that great and the <i> cord is short <i> . [Considering, is, is] [great, short]
I broke them in according to the instructions, using their website, which helped increase the sound quality of the headphones. [broke, according, using, helped, increase] [sound]
CONS: Just get better headphones, they dont even stay in your ears if you give the cord a tug. [get, dont, stay, give] [better]
The cord are surprisingly sturdy, and the all-metal body probably won't fall apart any time soon. [are, fall] [sturdy, all-metal]
My complaint with these headphones probably comes down to the type of rubber/plastic used in the cord and the ear plugs. [comes, used] [rubber\]
The cord is very rigid almost plastic material and does not stay wrapped up on my arm-band. [is, does, stay, wrapped] [rigid, plastic]
For the earbud issue, the cord, and minus the two buttons makes them inferior to the original iphone earbuds. [makes] [earbud, inferior, original]
It's most noticeable when listening to something like Sting: the bass and treble are over-emphasized and Sting sounds like he's way at the back of the recording studio somewhere on an improperly-amped mic. ['s, listening, are, 's] [noticeable, over-emphasized, Sting, improperly-amped]
While the buds fit well in my ears and did a good job of isolating external sound, the <i> cord is too short <i> and cannot feed under my coat to my coat pocket as I can do with my Shures. [fit, did, isolating, is, feed, do] [good, external, short]
An extra 10-15cm of cord would have fixed this problem, and I recommend that JLab fixes this, too. [have, fixed, recommend] [extra]
Now, the sound ebbs in and out,  <i> stuttering as the cord moves <i> . [ebbs, stuttering] [sound]
The Denons don't have as much bass but are much clearer, sound very smooth, and do not have as much cord noise. [do, have, are, do, have] [much, much, clearer, sound, smooth, much]
First the <i> cord is thin <i> and metallic (seems very delicate). [is, seems] [thin, metallic, delicate]
I think issues with ear buds tend to relate to the  <i> cord not being thick <i>  and sturdy enough to protect the wires within. [think, tend, relate, being, protect] [thick, sturdy, enough]
The cord on these ear buds was much, much thinner than the two I mentioned above. [was, mentioned] [much, thinner]
I got them because the cord looked more durable and I got an amazing deal at a close-out sale ($1. [got, looked, got] [durable, amazing, close-out]
The ear buds fit great, the sound was killer and the cord was the only one that did not disintegrate after using it for running for a few months. [fit, was, was, did, disintegrate, using, running] [great, only, few]
I am not an exceptionally tall man so the cord length generally wasn't an issue unless I tried to keep it in a coat pocket. [am, was, tried, keep] [tall]
It was a nice plastic coating over a braided cord which I thought would make for a sturdy cord that could hold up to the rigors of a 3 day a week runner. [was, thought, make, hold] [nice, braided, sturdy]
The <i> cord feels thin <i> and flimsy as compared to the thick, reinforced cord of the J2. [feels, compared, reinforced] [thin, flimsy, thick]
There was static whenever the  <i> cord moved  <i> and the volume adjust never worked. [was, moved, adjust, worked] [static]
The cord seems pretty strong, though it took a while to get used to the sound conductivity (the cord itself conducts sound into my ears from things like bumping against my chest when I walk or run, rubbing against my shirt, etc. [seems, took, get, used, conducts, bumping, walk, run, rubbing] [strong, sound]
I also can't seem to turn off the mic, so I hear rustling as the  <i> cord bounces  <i> around, but I expect that should be an easy fix. [seem, turn, hear, bounces, expect, be] [easy]
The sound only goes through if the cord is held in a very specific and peculiar position. [goes, is, held] [specific, peculiar]
The cord was nice and tangle-resistant and there is a generous ratio of metal to plastic in their construction, which is rare to find in a good, affordable set of earbuds. [was, is, is, find] [nice, tangle-resistant, generous, rare, good, affordable]
One negative point I read about this product in other reviews is the "sound" it makes when the cord hits something while listening to music. [read, is, makes, hits, listening] [negative, other]
Considering these are in-ear earphones that tightly sit inside one's ear isolating outside noise, anything that comes in contact with the cord is going to produce a sound that travels straight to the ear and will definitely be noticeable. [Considering, are, sit, isolating, comes, is, going, produce, travels, be] [in-ear, outside, straight, noticeable]
But don't confused this noise reduction for more expensive headphones which electronically monitor ambient sound levels and adjust accordingly. [do, confused, monitor, adjust] [expensive, ambient]
i would not recommend this to anyone, they should not cost more than two dollars, as they are poorly constructed, and when you touch the cord while they are in your ears, you hear a lot of noise. [recommend, cost, are, constructed, touch, are, hear] [more]
While the sound quality of the headphones is good, the <i> cord is a bit too short <i> , making it less than optimal when I run with them (and keep my iPod in my pocket). [is, is, making, run, keep] [sound, good, short, less, optimal]
The first issue that came up was the  <i> extra long cord length <i> . [came, was] [first, extra, long]
Since the ear fit for this brand is not very powerful, any slight touch on the very long cord disrupted the earphone in the ear, it just slipped out of my ear. [is, disrupted, slipped] [powerful, slight, long]
The <i> cord is very short <i> and overall i don't like the J3. [is, do, like] [short, overall]
The new pair again, sound quality is great but the mic doesn't work right, producing a heavy feedback sound that makes them petty much useless for recording anything. [is, does, work, producing, makes, recording] [new, sound, great, heavy, petty, much, useless]
Probably due to the cord being pulled on a few too many times. [being, pulled] [due, few, many]
To make matters worse, the <i> cord is much shorter <i> than the regular JBuds. [make, is] [much, shorter, regular]
I'm constantly accidentally yanking them out of my ears because there just is not enough  <i> length in the cord <i> . ['m, yanking, is] [enough]
So the entire time I'm listening with these ear buds I'm worrying about having to shove them deep into my ears to get any sort of nice sound and I'm having to attend to this ridiculously <i> short cord <i> . ['m, listening, 'm, worrying, having, shove, get, 'm, having, attend] [entire, nice, short]
The <i> cord is short <i> . [is] [short]
The  <i> cord is way too long <i> ! [is] [long]
The <i> cord is thinner <i> and cheaper, than my other ear buds that I received from them. [is, received] [thinner, cheaper, other]
My issue with them is that their <i> cord is thin <i> and cheap, often tying itself up in knots in my bag. [is, is, tying] [thin, cheap]
The wires inside the  <i> cord are equally thin <i>  and broke next to the elbow connector after about 6 months of use, rendering the earbuds useless. [are, broke, rendering] [thin, next, useless]
They do look nice, and the cord coils up very well. [do, look, coils] [nice]
I really like the design from the cord to the earpiece but it is rather fragile. [is] [fragile]
PROS: fun colors, long cord, convenient case for portable protection CONS: product reliability/durability - fails in less than a year. [fails] [convenient, portable, less]
Otherwise really good packaging, good design of the cord, they look like they are made out of high quality material. [look, are, made] [good, good, high]
They look great, are very comfortable to wear, and the short cord is a good thing for petite folks and youngsters. [look, are, wear, is] [great, comfortable, short, good, petite]
- Every touch on the  <i> cord echos <i>  in your ear, making them impractical for low volume use Close but no cigar, I'm going back to Sennheiser. [echos, making, 'm, going] [impractical, low, Close]
The biggest problem with them is if you even slightly touch the cord while the headphones are in it sounds like a thunderstorm in your ears. [is, touch, are, sounds] [biggest]
I was happy with them while they worked (although the  <i> cord was excessively long <i> ), but the left speaker stopped working yesterday, about half a year after my purchase. [was, worked, was, left, stopped, working] [happy, long]
I received these in record time (the day before the race) and after reading the enclosure and the reviews on Amazon, I "seasoned" the earbuds by letting the iPod play overnight at a medium to loud setting. [received, reading, letting] [seasoned, loud]
The  <i> cord looks a little weak  <i> and I'm not sure how these would hold up to long term use. [looks, 'm, hold] [little, weak, sure, long]
Another aggrevating thing about the headphones is whenever you have the phones in you can hear the  <i> muffled sound of the cord <i>  moving through the earphones. [is, have, hear, muffled, moving] [aggrevating]
If I finangle the cord in just the correct way, they work, but otherwise no go. [finangle, work] [correct]
at first it would crackle in and out when I moved the cord around, and then it conked completely. [crackle, moved, conked] [first]
The  <i> cord length is way too long <i>  and thin; this creates a cord tangle problem that is worse than normal. [is, creates, is] [long, thin, worse, normal]
Fumbling with the cord where it plugs in makes the sound come on and off. [Fumbling, plugs, makes, come] [sound]
I bought these earphones about 6 months ago when the cord on my original iPod earbuds started to strip and you could see the wires. [bought, started, see] [original, iPod]
They fit great for walking around the neighborhood, but the simple swinging of the cord (until I fed them under my shirt) wiggled the buds loose. [fit, walking, fed, wiggled] [great, simple]
The earbuds themselves seem to be a little more durable than those from the J2s, however the  <i> cord seems to be a little thin <i> . [seem, be, seems, be] [durable, little, thin]
I was surprised to learn that the J2  <i> cord is a little thicker <i>  and what feels to be a lot more durable. [was, surprised, learn, is, feels, be] [little, thicker, more, durable]
The  <i> cord makes SO much noise <i>  when it hits and rubs against things. [makes, hits, rubs] [much]
[[EDIT: I read that wearing them around the ear prevents most of the cord movement noise. [read, wearing, prevents] [most]
Wrapping the cord around your ear rather than letting the cord just dangle gets rid of a considerable amount of the noise you don't want to hear. [Wrapping, letting, gets, do, want, hear] [rid, considerable]
the  <i> cord is slightly shorter <i>  than the default ipod headphones. [is] [shorter]
We are talking a couple inches or so, but since i prefer a  <i> longer cord <i>  to begin with even that made a difference. [are, talking, prefer, begin, made] [longer]
Unfortunately, I'm suddenly having problems with the point where the cord meets the plug, and can only use these headphones when the cord is in a particular orientation and I'm not moving. ['m, having, meets, use, is, 'm, moving] [particular]
Although I'm a bit clumsy, and can be a little rough on my headphones, I don't recall doing anything recently that could have caused this, nor have I ever had a pair of headphones that had such a <i> weak cord <i> . ['m, be, do, recall, doing, have, caused, have, had, had] [clumsy, little, rough, such, weak]
As far as the headphones go, they fit well, the cord is good and doesn't tangle easily. [go, fit, is, does, tangle] [good]
I would have thought JLab would have reinforced where the cable cord meets the audio jack. [have, thought, have, reinforced, meets] [audio]
Every time the cord touched something it reverberated into the headset, the sound quality was very tinny and there was absolutely no bass response. [touched, reverberated, was, was] [sound, tinny]
The male end of the  <i> cord is bend <i>  rather than straight like the Apple earbuds that come with the iPod, and it just looks awkward. [is, bend, earbuds, come, looks] [male, awkward]
Also, there is no permanent joint in the wire, and when you first get them you have to  <i> rip the cord <i>  apart yourself and hope they don't rip any more. [is, get, have, rip, hope, do, rip] [permanent, more]
I'm tall, and the cord still dangles almost to my knees when I've got them on, and unless I wrap it up or shove it in my pocket, it catches on everything (door handles, chair arms, EVERYTHING) and rips them out of my ears. ['m, dangles, 've, got, wrap, shove, catches, handles, rips] [tall]
To my dismay, they are going the way of all cheaper headphones and earbuds - the sound changes depending on the positioning of the cord. [are, going, depending] [cheaper, sound]
So I've got to generally keep the cord straightened, or curved, or whatever in order to get an unaffected listening experience. ['ve, got, keep, straightened, curved, get] [unaffected]
Ideally I would prefer a thicker cord, or at least more insulation on the  <i> cord as it's so thin <i>  it looks like it could be severed if you caught it in a zipper. [prefer, 's, looks, be, severed, caught] [thicker, least, thin]
I tried wearing the earbuds loosely, rather than sealing them, so they wouldn't conduct the  <i> noisy movement of the cord <i> , but then they didn't stay in my ears. [tried, wearing, sealing, conduct, did, stay] [noisy]
well this is a edit of my first review, after a 48 hr breakin these do sound good only if you push them tight in ears if they get lose witch they do quite easy its sounds like a tin can, and these only sound good if you are not moving at all, if you move around the  <i> cord makes noise <i>  that overwhelms the music its very bad, over all these are not good for anything unless you sit in one spot and dont move. [is, do, sound, push, get, lose, do, are, moving, move, makes, overwhelms, are, sit] [first, good, tight, easy, sound, good, bad, good, dont]
they still get a 1 star rating if there was a negative star rating thats what they would get, the  <i> cord noise <i>  is seen in other reviews here so its not a defect its what you get. [get, was, thats, get, is, seen, get] [negative, other]
who cares if they sound good if all you hear is  <i> noise from cord <i> . [cares, sound, hear, is] [good]
the  <i> cord is kind of long <i> , and i like long cord but im 6 ft and it touches the floor. [is] [long]
The adapters (even the cord) seem to be made of poor-quality materials. [seem, be, made] [poor-quality]
However, after about a month of usage, sound started to flicker out of the right earbud, although I could sometimes get it back if I fiddled with the cord enough. [started, flicker, get, fiddled] [sound, right]
The earphones produce a little better quality sound than the cheaper version, but the  <i> cord is much worse <i>  than that of the cheaper version. [produce, is] [little, better, cheaper, worse, cheaper]
As I said before, I can live with the sound quality but the  <i> cord noise is still a big issue <i>  for me. [said, live, is] [sound, big]
First of all, the length of the cord reveals the height-ist nature of the R&D folks who designed it. [reveals, designed] [height-ist]
Also, due to material from which the cord is made, the bouncing of the cord against my chest interferes with the sound quality as the it provides it's own soundtrack over my music that can be likened to an off-beat high school marching band bass drum player or the irregular heartbeat of a large mammal. [is, made, bouncing, interferes, provides, 's, be, likened, marching, drum] [due, sound, own, off-beat, high, irregular, large]
There is also no carrying case so you'll have to figure out some other way of storing and managing the cord. [is, carrying, have, figure, storing, managing] [other]
I do like that the cord is of equal length from each bud. [do, is] [equal]
 <i> short cord <i> , trebly, hearing-reducing sound, and an ever-breaking, annoying unraveling thin cord that will drive most men insane. [annoying, drive] [short, hearing-reducing, thin, insane]
No visible damage either (no frayed cord, etc), so it may be a defect in the manufacturing. [frayed, be] [visible]
Ordered these thinking they would be good according to the reviews, I was wrong. [Ordered, thinking, be, according, was] [good, wrong]
The cord on the headphones is alot longer than many headphones, so I also had to wrap the cord around my ipod so it wouldn't get tangled while I exercise. [is, had, wrap, get, tangled, exercise] [longer, many]
-----OLD REVIEW------ PROS: extremely loud - volume on the lowest setting - clear, quality sound when playing music; great fit; awesome look; cord doesn't tangle CONS: wanna-be noise canceling blows; gives me a headache! [playing, does, tangle, canceling, gives] [-----, ------, loud, lowest, clear, great, awesome, wanna-be]
But then the part where the plug meets the  <i> cord on my par has already worn <i>  out. [meets, has] [worn]
That being said if you are very gentle with your headphones and don't rap the cord than these are for you. [being, said, are, do, are] [gentle]
More flexible cord lies more naturally and comfortably. [lies] [flexible]
The cord is of generous length and overall, the build of it is pretty solid. [is, build, is] [generous, overall, solid]
However, on a live recording or anything with a bit of static it becomes very apparent. [becomes] [live, static, apparent]
New buds vs Old buds -New buds have straight connector instead of angle connector (BIGGEST ISSUE for me) -New buds have a much  <i> stiffer cord <i>  making it more difficult to wrap up and stuff in the travel case. [vs, have, have, making, wrap] [straight, much, stiffer, difficult]
The  <i> cord do not de-tangle easily <i>  and seem to get caught in my clothes. [do, seem, get, caught] [de-tangle]
The sound quality was not great and you get a lot of  <i> echo when the cord moves <i> . [was, get, echo] [sound, great]
Then after about four months, the left ear stopped working unless I turned the cord a specific way and didn't move it at all, which was a pain. [left, stopped, working, turned, did, move, was] [specific]
Overall I liked them because the sound was good (when stuffed into your ear) and the  <i> cord was kind of rubbery  <i> and stiff so it never got tangled. [liked, was, stuffed, was, got, tangled] [Overall, good, stiff]
Also of note for all our Android users out there, the button on the  <i> cord doesn't work <i>  with my Nexus One. [does, work] [Android]
The extra length of the JBuds ear buds cord is a plus and the noise canceling properties are effective. [is, canceling, are] [extra, effective]
The length of the cord doesn't allow for anyone over five feet tall to do so without an arm band. [does, allow, do] [tall]

WARNING: Untokenizable: § (char in decimal: 167)
There is a little ring that &iexcl;Â§cinches&iexcl;Â¨ the indiv cables of the right and left earphones so you can adjust the amount of  <i> loose cord <i>  quickly and easily. [is, cinches, left, adjust] [little, loose]
Even the  <i> cord is thinner  <i> and they even cut serious costs with the packaging. [is, cut] [thinner, serious]
Not just the ear piece itself, but the entire cord from where the  <i> cord come together came off <i> . [come, came] [entire]
*Anti-Tangle cord is amazing and works really well. [is, works] [amazing]
The noise from the  <i> cord is so bad <i>  you can't even being to focus on the sound coming out of the ear buds. [is, being, focus, coming] [bad]
The cord is nice and long, and the silicon pieces fit well enough. [is, fit] [nice]
Each pair only lasted about 6 months of daily use, and then the  <i> cord must've become separated <i>  in the plug part, and that was the end of them. [lasted, 've, become, was] [daily, separated]
It is on the brink of being too short to plug into my laptop on my desk and making it to my ears without having a tight cord. [is, being, plug, making, having] [short, tight]
I may actually contact JLab support on this to see if this is a normal cord length for the J3 because it is something you see in reviews all the time. [contact, see, is, is, see] [JLab, normal]
So, as far as sound quality goes, I find these better than the J2, but beware of the cord length. [goes, find] [sound, better]
Still sounds good, but the cord. [sounds] [good]
From my email to Jlab:  "The J3 cord is a full 8 inches shorter than my J2s. [is] [full, shorter]
The earpieces are snug enough to wear while running without falling out, but the sound of the  <i> cord rubbing against the body <i>  comes through louder than the music. [are, wear, running, falling, rubbing, comes] [snug, enough]
Sound quality was fine, but if you move and the cord rub on something, anything, you hear every movement. [was, move, rub, hear] [Sound, fine]
The <i> cord length is too short <i> and tangles easily. [is, tangles] [short]
2 - because the <i> cord is so rigid <i> , it carries sound to your ears WAY too well. [is, carries] [rigid]
They work great at reproducing music, but if I so much as turn my head, I get a significant amount of white noise when the  <i> cord scrapes <i>  along my shirt, or the desk, or anything at all. [work, reproducing, turn, get, scrapes] [great, significant, white]
I found I could get the sound back for a while if I bent the cord a certain way, but it would simply go out again. [found, get, go] [bent, certain]
While they looked good and the cord never got tangled, the microphone NEVER worked at all. [looked, got, tangled, worked] [good]
Updated 7-8-11: No noticeable wear on the cord or ear pieces. [Updated] [noticeable]
I have found that routing the cord thru my shirt, or tucking it in the collar of my shirt helps most of the time, but does not totally eliminate the thumping noise being transmitted into the earbuds. [have, found, routing, tucking, helps, does, eliminate, thumping, being, transmitted] [most]
Also, it needs more length where the cord splits to left and right sides. [needs, splits, left] [more, right]
These headphones have a great sound, but the <i> cord is so noisy <i> ! [have, is] [great, noisy]
These fit great, but anytime the cord hit my shirt, it was so loud and it sounded like I was using a stethoscope. [hit, was, sounded, was, using] [fit, great, loud]
The sound quality is good for the price; the  <i> cord is everywhere <i>  and can be hard to unravel; the buds have to be pressed into my ear, and they slip while I'm sitting listening to music or video on my ipod. [is, is, be, unravel, have, be, pressed, slip, 'm, sitting, listening] [sound, good, hard]
Not only is the sound quality different, but the earphone jack and cord are different which leads me to believe that I either received a knock-off version of this product or perhaps they changed the model slightly. [is, are, leads, believe, received, changed] [sound, different, earphone, different, knock-off]
the only good thing is the cord is longer. [is, is] [good]
Part of the problem, though, is the <i>  overly long cord <i> . [is] [long]
The <i> cord noise is unbearable <i> . [is] [unbearable]
I can actually hear my feet thumping as I walk, this cord noise drowns out my actual music. [hear, thumping, walk, drowns] [actual]
I'm used to the tangle-free cord on my Sony MDR-E829V ($7. ['m, used] [tangle-free]
it keeps slipping out and the <i> cord is a little cheap <i> . [keeps, slipping, is] [little, cheap]
)  The  <i> cord is a little short <i> , but most of the time it doesn't both me. [is, does] [little, short, most]
I have also started experiencing problems with the sound cutting out on one side, okay on the other, then okay when you jiggle the cord. [have, started, experiencing, cutting, jiggle] [sound, okay, other, okay]
After a week of this, the ear buds have become extremely touchy and only work when I hold the cord in a specific position or twist the cord or they just stop working all together. [have, become, hold, twist, stop, working] [touchy, only, specific]
Every little movement of the cord is amplified deep within my middle ear and it is extremely annoying. [is, amplified, is] [little, deep, middle, annoying]
I can get the sound back if I wiggle the cord just right, but the sweet spot for that is getting more and more difficult to hit. [get, wiggle, is, getting, hit] [sweet, difficult]
The <i> cord is very rigid <i> , and after being stored it wants to hold its "curled up" shape, which is annoying. [is, being, stored, wants, hold, curled, is, annoying] [rigid]
Worse though is the transfer of sound from the movement of the  <i> rigid cord <i> . [is] [Worse, rigid]
Unless I am perfectly still, my music, or whatever else I might be listening to, is constantly joined by scraping type sounds as the  <i> rigid cord <i>  brushes against my clothing or other surfaces. [am, be, listening, is, joined, scraping] [rigid, other]
I was thrilled with these - they fit great, sounded great (although didn't greatly reduce ambient sound) but after having them for only 3 days - one of the cord had 2 cracks in the black plastic through which I could see the silver wire underneath. [was, thrilled, fit, sounded, did, reduce, having, had, see] [great, great, ambient, black]
They still work, but I had to wrap the cord in electrip tape where the rips were and it makes an unpleasant lump. [work, had, wrap, were, makes] [electrip, unpleasant]
Instead of being able to move while using these headphones, you must hold the cord in a certain position now. [being, move, using, hold] [able, certain]
Concerns:  The <i> cord is VERY noisy <i> compared to all other in-ear headphones I have owned before. [is, compared, have, owned] [noisy, other, in-ear]
I realize that there will always be some  <i> cord interference <i>  due to them being inside your ear, but to me the feedback produced from these is close to unacceptable. [realize, be, being, produced, is] [due, unacceptable]
Unless my music is cranked way up, I can hear a loud bumping noise every time I so much as rub the cord. [is, cranked, hear] [loud]
The <i>  cord is coated pretty hard <i> , plastic-like material which seems to be the culprit. [is, seems, be] [coated, plastic-like]
Overall, I love the way they look, sound, and feel, but I am considering finding another pair simply because of the  <i> feedback caused by the cord <i> . [love, look, feel, am, considering, finding, caused] [sound]
I'm willing to deal with some  <i> cord feedback <i> , but these provide too much for my liking. ['m, deal, provide] [willing, much]
Otherwise, they are very tinny (too much treble) and worst of all, the  <i> cord makes noise <i>  when moved or touched. [are, makes, moved, touched] [tinny, much, worst]
When I am listening to my IPod wearing these headphones, whenever I touch or move the cord, the sound is amplified through the earplugs and I hear the movement of the cord. [am, listening, wearing, touch, move, is, amplified, hear] [IPod]
The pearlescent pink with metallic details is so sleek and pretty and the design of the cord is such that it never tangles the way my apple earbuds did. [is, is, tangles, did] [pink, metallic, sleek, such]
There is no exterior damage and I have always taken extra care to avoid unnecessary bends to the cord, but nevertheless, the wires inside have broken. [is, have, taken, avoid, have, broken] [exterior, extra, unnecessary]
This area where the cord connects to the plug is not reinforced, which is a major design flaw, and so disappointing because I loved these earbuds so much, but refuse to purchase them again only to have them break in another year. [connects, is, reinforced, is, loved, refuse, purchase, have, break] [major, disappointing]
In response to other comments I have seen, the cord length works just fine for me, as I am 5'4 and the cord is plenty long enough for my height. [have, seen, works, am, is] [other, fine, plenty]
Some people have also commented about audible vibrations when the  <i> cord hits against your chest  <i> or brushes against something, which I can verify happened with mine, but this never particularly bothered me. [have, commented, hits, verify, happened, bothered] [audible]
The JBud J2s appear to have a stronger cord/plug connection, but as the J3s are supposedly an upgrade from these, and are much sleeker, I chose the J3s for $5 more, I am considering trying the J2s, but am hesitant to return to try this brand again, and may be better off with Panasonic Slimz, V-Moda Vibes, or MEElectronics M6s. [appear, have, are, are, chose, am, considering, trying, am, return, try, be] [stronger, much, more, better]
The JVCs cord is completely stripped to the wires, but they are that much better. [is, stripped, are] [better]
When I received the headphones, I was pleased with the sturdiness of the cord and everything seemed of high enough quality construction to last, but after a little over two months, one of the buds went out, and I ordered a pair of <a href="http://www. [received, was, pleased, seemed, went, ordered] [high, enough, last, little]
I use my mp3 player almost exclusively for exercising, and even though I use a clip to secure the headphone cord to my jacket or shirt (to eliminate the tendency of the cord to pull the buds out of my ears), I often find that the buds eventually start to get loose and I need to push them back in, or they get sweaty and I need to dry them off. [use, exercising, use, secure, eliminate, pull, find, start, get, need, push, get, need, dry] [mp3, loose, sweaty]
The Zune headphones I am replacing have a stem on the bottom of the earphone, which makes it easier to position the buds and push them in- but the JBuds just have the earphone itself and then the cord. [am, replacing, have, makes, position, push, have] [easier, earphone]
I guess I'll take my chances and maybe be a little more careful with how I wrap the cord around my Walkman. [guess, take, be, wrap] [careful]
Speaking of which- the JBuds description said they have a "micro-braided anti-tangle cable" so I expected them to have the same sort of covering as the Zunes, but instead it looks and feels like any other headphone cord. [Speaking, said, have, expected, have, covering, looks, feels] [micro-braided, anti-tangle, same, other]
3/10/10 Update:  I've been using these at work and the sound and quality blockage of external noise is nice, but the "stethoscope" effect of hearing the  <i> cord rubbing on my clothes <i> , etc. ['ve, been, using, is, hearing, rubbing] [external, nice]
I tried jogging with the default sized earbud tips and I didn't make it a block before I had to come home and switch back to my old earbuds--each step thundered through my body right into my ears, and the  <i> cord rubbing on me <i>  was really loud too. [tried, sized, did, make, had, come, switch, thundered, rubbing, was] [earbud, old, loud]
The first ones I had I would wrap the cord around my iPhone and therefor thought it was my fault. [had, wrap, thought, was] [first]
They are comfy have a nice long cord and really do cut down on outside noise. [are, have, do, cut] [comfy, nice, long, outside]
That being said, i only had these earbuds for a few months before the  <i> cord broke <i>  near the jack. [being, said, had, broke] [few]
According to her, the sound is excellent. [According, is] [excellent]
I liked my previous JLabs ear buds (the next level up from these) which I got for around $35, but the  <i> cord connections frayed <i> , compromising the sound. [liked, got, frayed, compromising] [previous, next]
If I hold the microphone between two fingers while talking on the phone this produces a significant background  <i> static If the cord <i>  (not the mike) bumps on my shirt, there's a big bump noise in the ears. [hold, talking, produces, 's] [significant, static, big]
Also, the amount of <i> cord noise is ridiculous <i> . [is] [ridiculous]
The <i> cord is so incredibly short <i> that these barely reach from pocket to ears, and that couple with the problem of them staying in your ear becomes a SUPER problem. [is, reach, staying, becomes] [short, SUPER]
Because there is no slack from the  <i> shortness of the cord <i> , the headphones will be pulled out of your ear at the slightest touch of the cord. [is, be, pulled] [slightest]
While walking the  <i> cord bangs against my chest  <i> and I hear that sound quite loudly. [walking, bangs, hear] [sound]
I loved the color and the sleek design of the cord also. [loved] [sleek]
They fit comfortably in the ear, the length of cord is decent, and the sound was good to me. [fit, is, was] [decent, good]
They are basically unusable today unless I wrap the cord in a certain way and stay completely still, and even then only one side works. [are, wrap, stay] [unusable, certain]
similar sound you'd get if the cord wasn't plugged completely in the device). [get, was, plugged] [similar]
Next thing I know,i have to fiddle with the cord just to get both earbuds to work! [know, have, get, work] [Next]
The  <i> cord is so long that <i>  it is simply impossible for it not to get tangled or become a nuisance. [is, is, get, tangled, become] [long, impossible]
My kitten chewed up the cord to my old creative ep-630s. [chewed] [kitten, old, creative]
I was very pleased with these headphones until, three months later, one of the headphones got scratchy and then stopped transmitting unless the cord was moved in a very precise way. [was, got, stopped, transmitting, was, moved] [pleased, scratchy, precise]
Now I only occasionally get sound in only one ear at a time if I have manipulated the cord in a very specific way. [get, sound, have, manipulated] [specific]
But this morning, when I put my ipod on, only the right side had sound (quite low I might add) and the left side would come on if I wiggled the cord. [put, had, add, come, wiggled] [right, sound, low, left]
The build on the Jbuds J3 are slightly better because the  <i> cord isn't awkward  <i> and I don't have problems with the padding slipping off. [build, are, is, do, have, slipping] [awkward]
The <i> cord is rubbery <i> , there's no adjustable clip, and the changeable rubber stoppers will get lost/damaged quickly if you're careless. [is, 's, get, lost\, 're] [adjustable, changeable, careless]
The Buds themselves feel kind of chintzy and you'll have to be careful with the cord -> bud connection. [feel, have, be] [chintzy, careful]
I'd give JBuds 5 stars in total but <i> cord noise is really a problem <i> . [give, is] [total]
Could jiggle the cord and get sporatic sound. [jiggle, get] [sporatic]
If I moved the cord around it would come in and out but it never stayed on consistently - flashback to when you try to get the sound for a movie in an airplane using your own headphones and you struggle trying to get the jack to go in just the right amount to get sound in both ears. [moved, come, stayed, try, get, using, struggle, trying, get, go, get] [own, right, sound]
So I guess buy them if you can make sure you're careful with the cord! [guess, buy, make, 're] [sure, careful]
Any movement or  <i> rubbing of the cord <i>  communicates a loud and infuriating rustling sound directly into your ears. [communicates] [loud, infuriating]
I'm still happy with my J3s for casual use on the train and walking around, but a cord that eliminates this noise issue would go a long ways to improving the JBuds line. ['m, walking, eliminates, go, improving] [happy, casual, long]
There is also minimal sound transferred to the headphones (and your ears) when the headphone cord rubs against something, another plus. [is, transferred, rubs] [minimal, sound]
The fit is comfortable and the look cool with the metallic cord and housing. [is] [comfortable, metallic]
But what annoys me the most is the fact that the <i> cord is short <i> . [is, is] [short]
A longer cord would add value! [add] [longer]
I don't know who they had in mind when they made this cord, but it must be for someone with a really long torso. [do, know, had, made, be] [long]
When you're running, you don't want a long black cord hanging all over the place. ['re, running, do, want, hanging] [long, black]
In the end I paid $5 extra for an inert bit of plastic on the headphone cord - don't bother. [paid, do, bother] [extra, inert]
The cord connection gave out in two weeks, so now I have great mono-sound with comfort, or I have great stero sound by physically holding the cord at a 178 degree angle. [gave, have, have, holding] [great, mono-sound, great]
I like these buds generally - they sound fine and look good; however, the  <i> cord is TOO SHORT <i> , I'm not thrilled with the way they fit, and they don't last any longer than any other buds I've found. [like, sound, look, is, 'm, thrilled, fit, do, last, 've, found] [fine, good, SHORT, longer, other]
I've bought a few pairs of them since I can't find my previous favorite any longer, and for the price I'm not terribly unhappy, but I continue to look for something that is more comfortable, has a longer cord, and lasts longer, while still looking good =). ['ve, bought, find, 'm, continue, look, is, has, lasts, looking] [few, previous, favorite, unhappy, comfortable, good]
They are small, black-on-black raised letters at the base of each bud at the cord entry point. [are, raised] [small, black-on-black]
Bass output is way down from that of the actual recorded music I am listening to. [is, am, listening] [actual, recorded]
These headphones stopped working the first week as the sound goes in and out as if the  <i> cord is loose <i> . [stopped, working, goes, is] [first, loose]
Sound quality is just fine for me, but if I so much as breathe on the cord, I get a thump, the way you would if you tapped a microphone for a sound check. [is, breathe, get, tapped] [Sound, fine, sound]
The sound is kind of dull after a few uses and I need to move the cord in order for the sound to come out. [is, need, move, come] [dull, few]
work well and at a good price, but not very comfortable and if you are bumping it around sound travels through the cord. [are, bumping] [good, comfortable, sound]
-The <i> cord is VERY cheap <i> . [is] [cheap]
These earphones might be perfect if not for the  <i> cord noise <i> . [be] [perfect]
However, what we have here are decently constructed ear pieces with a thin nylon type cord, and this covering will not offer much protection, so you will need to be careful. [have, are, constructed, covering, offer, need, be] [thin, much, careful]
When I first bought these, I thought they were fabulous -- the cord almost never tangled and the sound was quite good. [bought, thought, were, tangled, was] [fabulous, good]
So after a few months, the  <i> cord broke <i>  on one side on both of my pairs. [broke] [few]
It makes them more prone to wiggle around from tension or  <i> disturbances on the cord <i> . [makes, wiggle] [prone]
i was surprised by the  <i> thickness of the cord <i> , it feels alot stronger than a typical headphone cord, which i really like. [was, surprised, feels] [stronger, typical]
my only complaint so far is the amount of telescope sound that i am getting through the cord movements. [is, am, getting] [only]
To keep this in reference, I tried the headphones through a variety of different products and different quality of audio recordings. [keep, tried] [different, different, audio]
While a higher recording definitely sounded better, the same issues with boomy bass and overall muddy sound remained. [sounded, remained] [higher, better, same, boomy, overall, muddy]
The sound is fine, comfort level is perfectly fine but there is a  <i> rip in the cord <i>  and one of the ears is already breaking up and cutting out. [is, is, is, is, breaking, cutting] [fine, fine]
The  <i> cord itself is very, very thin <i>  so it's already apparent that the wiring is not very well protected. [is, 's, is, protected] [thin, apparent]
I also don't like the way they fit in my ear and the <i> cord is too short <i> . [do, like, fit, is] [short]
Additionally, just sitting at my desk at work - where I primarily use the J3s since they are not good for the gym - often leads to issues just from moving in my chair and having the cord hit the desk, keyboard, etc. [sitting, use, are, leads, moving, having, hit] [good]
I prefer the build quality of the actual headphones on these over any others I've purchased (and that's many), but I prefer the cord of the J2s. [prefer, build, 've, purchased, 's, prefer] [actual, many]
The cord on the J3s doesn't flex well and it's awkward. [does, flex, 's] [awkward]
The cord is more plastic- y than I expected and very short as we'll, which is an issue for me. [is, expected, is] [plastic, short]
Overall, these are high quality earbuds for the price if you can deal with the uncomfortable fit and  <i> short cord <i> . [are, deal] [high, uncomfortable, short]
The first is the length of the cord. [is] [first]
