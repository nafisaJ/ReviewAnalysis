Earphone Jack - The earphone jack on the original Clip and the new Clip + is in the same location. [is] [earphone, original, new, same]
On the original clip, the earphone jack is on a flat part of the unit. [is] [original, earphone, flat]
- The earphone jack on the new Clip + is on a slanted edge so that it doesn't fit in all the way. [is, does, fit] [earphone, new, slanted]
At first, I thought I was kind of interesting how it made my music sound (separated as if there was someone singing karaoke to the instrumentals), but it got old fast and I simply corrected it by wiggling earphone jack a bit. [thought, was, made, separated, was, singing, got, corrected, wiggling] [interesting, old, fast, earphone]
The unit had a  <i> short in the head phone jack <i>  so i could not use it. [had, use] [short]
Plugs right into the auxilary jack and sounds great. [sounds] [auxilary, great]
the earphone  <i> jack is so bad  <i> that it disconnected the plastic cover from its internal wire when pulling the earphone jack out; please note that the same earphone (JLAB) has been paired with the old Sansa and never had this problem. [is, disconnected, pulling, please, has, been, paired, had] [earphone, bad, internal, earphone, same, old]
3 Fuzes and 2 Clips, all brand new and every single one had  <i> faulty head phone jacks <i> . [had] [new, single, faulty]
On the new model, the volume control has been moved to the left side and way  <i> too close to the USB jack <i> . [has, been, moved] [new, left]
This player would have been a 5 star buy for me, but recently the headphone  <i> jack has loosened <i>  after only a few months of use, and I have to keep constant pressure on the headphone plug lest the sound cut out in my left ear. [have, been, has, loosened, have, keep, cut, left] [few, constant]
Today while listening to an audio, I heard a large pop in my ear (wow it hurt) and then I  <i> couldn't hear anything from the jack <i>  anymore. [listening, heard, wow, hurt, hear] [large]
Sadly, once I loaded the music I found that the earphone connection was not tight enough, and the  <i> connection was lost when the jack <i>  was fully inserted. [loaded, found, was, was, lost, was, inserted] [earphone, tight]
The headphone port on my unit did  <i> not securely hold the headphone jack <i> , causing the sound to cut in and out at the slightest jostling. [did, hold, causing, cut] [slightest]
The headphone  <i> jack was suspect  <i> from the very first second I put the headphones in. [was, put] [suspect, first, second]
I exchanged my SanDisk for a Sony, and wouldn't you know it: the Sony headphone jack works great. [exchanged, know, works] [great]
I discovered that the headphone  <i> jack was loose <i> . [discovered, was] [loose]
Sometimes I had to  <i> giggle the earphone jack <i>  awhile to get the sound through the earphones, then if I move the device, say like I walk around the room, it would lose the connection again. [had, get, move, say, walk, lose] [earphone]
The headphone <i>  jacks are very cheap <i>  and within 1-2 weeks, 2 of the 3 clips have become unusable b/c one channel cuts in and out all the time. [are, have, become] [cheap, unusable, b\]
Now the headphone <i>  jack has a shortage in it  <i> and I have to constantly fiddle with it to get sound in left and right sides of the headphones. [has, have, get] [sound, left, right]
It had a  <i> bad audio jack <i> , but Amazon was great and replaced it quickly. [had, was, replaced] [bad, great]
The thing worked fine until the headphone <i>  jack went on the fritz <i> . [worked, went] [fine]
All I did was try to remove the headphones from the jack- nothing abnormal- and the plastic coating came right off! [did, was, try, remove, came] [abnormal]
Within 2 weeks of owning these, both of them broke, my husband's earphone jack and my volume button. [owning, broke] [earphone]
The headphone  <i> jack seemed loose  <i> and would lose connection if the player were even slightly jiggled (certainly not good for use while jogging or exercising). [seemed, lose, were, jiggled, exercising] [loose, good]
The buttons aren't as responsive, the headphone  <i> jack can be sensitive  <i> for some headphones, and the volume buttons (which I use often) are in a less convenient and awkward position on the device. [are, be, use, are] [responsive, sensitive, convenient, awkward]
The headphone jack is in the same place (right-side of device) which means that most people will clip it to their left pocket (do people clip these other places? [is, means, clip, left, do, clip] [same, most, other]
Then for some reason the earphone  <i> jack won't work <i> . [work] [earphone]
When I took the player out yesterday to use while I was hiking it would only work OK with the phone jack inserted just right. [took, use, was, hiking, work, inserted] [OK]
All three had same problem, with multiple jacks. [had] [same, multiple]
Addendum: Shortly after writing this review, the audio  <i> jack on this player flaked out <i>  on me. [writing, flaked] [audio]
Pros: - small size - light weight - simplicity of design - memory expansion - MTP interface (next three items)   - drag and drop via Windows Explorer   - can create & use playlists that are simply text files with folder/file names   - ability to play by folder Cons: - the power button stopped working (I understand this is a common problem) - the headphone  <i> jack was kind of bad <i>  -- you have to keep adjusting the cord until you can get both channels - the battery indicator wasn't of much value: I could start a run with the indicator down only one notch but it would soon die Before the Clip+, I had a Fuse whose display went out, presumably from sweat damage. [create, use, are, play, stopped, working, understand, is, was, have, keep, adjusting, get, was, start, die, had, went] [small, light, next, folder\, common, bad, much]
I do really like the shuffle feature, the ability to jack it in directly to my car radio thru the aux in jack, a few pretty simple controls, and lots of features. [do, jack] [few, pretty, simple]
I hate that the earphone  <i> jack does not fit  <i> securely into the receptacle and almost any movement disrupts the sound. [hate, does, disrupts] [earphone, fit]
This time around the headphone  <i> jack became loose <i>  and ceased to work (after about 5 mo of daily use). [became, ceased, work] [loose, daily]
However I went out and got a starter soldering kit and was able to repair the headphone jack - it works better than ever now. [went, got, was, repair, works] [starter, soldering, able, better]
The main problem with it has been the input  <i> jack which makes noise <i>  if the cord is moved even slightly using a wide variety of headphones and earbuds. [has, been, makes, is, moved, using] [main, wide]
It may not be difficult, but you don't get much in the way of instructions edit- it's become  <i> loose where you insert headphone jacks <i> . [be, do, get, 's, become, insert] [difficult, loose, headphone]
I've tried several jacks. ['ve, tried] [several]
Super fast shipping as always from Amazon but after I tore (and hacked and cut and cursed) the packaging open and got it charged up I was dismayed to discover that my earbuds were  <i> not compatible with the jack <i> . [shipping, tore, hacked, cut, cursed, got, charged, was, dismayed, discover, were] [open, compatible]
So I was going to just use it with the headphone jack and an AUX in; worked great for about 45 minutes then it just died. [was, going, use, worked, died] [great]
I assume this stems from using the auxillary jack in my car (I use Sansa Clip with audiobooks for my commutes alot) as that may have fried the innards of the device as some electrical output comes from the aux jack. [assume, stems, using, use, alot, have, fried, comes] [auxillary, electrical]
I have not used other mp3 players as frequently with the aux jack in my car so I cannot compare with other manufacturers. [have, used, compare] [other, mp3, other]
