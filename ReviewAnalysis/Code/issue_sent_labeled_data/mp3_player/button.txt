Just today (2/2/12) , when I hit the lockout button, the screen went black and I was unable to revive the machine even by putting it on the usb cable. [hit, went, was, revive, putting] [black, unable]
Then the power  <i> button became loose <i>  and would not even turn on when hooked onto charger. [became, turn] [loose, hooked]
The only other  <i> complaint is the power button <i>  and the volume button, not very ergonomic. [is] [only, other, ergonomic]
I  <i> have to click the button <i>  10 or more times in order to get a response. [have, click, get] [more]
This has happened to the Pause, Home and fast forward button so far. [has, happened] [fast]
Other than the  <i> button quality <i>  it has been great. [has, been] [Other, great]
Sometimes I have to keep pressing arbitrary button to get it to display anything--I cant even tell if it's on or not. [have, keep, pressing, get, display, cant, tell, 's] [arbitrary]
The first Clip I was sent had a  <i> defective volume down button <i> . [was, sent, had] [first, defective]
The replacement had a perfect volume button, but the FM player would not receive a signal from any station, outdoors, on a clear day. [had, receive] [perfect, clear]
I loved my little sansa clip until the volume  <i> button stopped working <i> . [loved, stopped, working] [little]
Battery-meter is inaccurate and I found it doesn't hold a charge as well as advertised I found out that you have to hold down the power button for like 15 seconds for it not drain its batter rapidly after you turn it off. [is, found, does, hold, advertised, found, have, hold, drain, turn] [inaccurate]
The power  <i> button stopped working <i> , the SanDisk people did not seem all that interested in my product return for warranty repair, put me on hold till they get around to checking  out my claim. [stopped, working, did, seem, put, get, checking] [interested]
And it's only the soft  <i> button that are no longer working <i> ; the unit still plays. ['s, are, working, plays] [soft]
When I got home I noticed even though the screen was black and I couldn't turn it on (even tried the 15 second power-button reset) the Clip+ was quite warm. [got, noticed, was, turn, tried, was] [black, second, power-button, warm]
Resetting using the reset  <i> button did nothing <i> , it is officially dead. [Resetting, using, did, is] [dead]
This "down" <i>  button is very close  <i> to the bottom edge of the player, and this pronounced slope means that it is still easy to depress it. [is, means, is, depress] [close, bottom, pronounced, easy]
- There is very little inward angle/slope on the surface of the control pad on the new Clip +, so pressing the "down"  <i> button is very difficult <i> . [is, pressing, is] [little, inward, new, difficult]
If you move your thumb inward for a better response, you tend to hit the center button instead. [move, tend, hit] [better]
The up, left, and right button are not affected by this as much, but the  <i> down button is nearly impossible for me to depress <i> . [left, are, affected, is, depress] [right, much, impossible]
button - Much has been made of the new placement of the button and controls on the new Clip +. [has, been, made] [Much, new, new]
The placement might be an improvement, but I find the new controls themselves very much inferior to the button and controls on the original Clip. [be, find] [new, inferior, original]
This has been changed to an on/off button on the top with the hold feature now on the Home button. [has, been, changed] [on\]
Unfortunately, the on/off  <i> button creaks annoyingly <i>  because of the unit's poorer build quality. [build] [on\, poorer]
Worst of all, the sides and top and bottom are slanted backwards, which means that the unit is much more  <i> difficult to hold onto particularly when pressing button <i> . [are, slanted, means, is, hold, pressing] [top, bottom, difficult]
The top and bottom of the unit are not attached that strongly and the two move relative to each other when  <i> button are depressed causing annoying creaks <i> . [are, attached, are, causing] [relative, other, depressed, annoying]
It also will not turn on sometimes and a combination of the home and different  <i> button needs to be held down <i>  to coax it back to life again. [turn, needs, be, held, coax] [different]
I tried the resetting process of keeping down the power button for about 20 seconds amongst several other things. [tried, resetting, keeping] [several, other]
The power  <i> button stopped working <i>  on one, another one the computer can't recognize when it gets plugged in, and the other two just froze, the screen froze, and the battery died and can be no longer be charged or turned on. [stopped, working, recognize, gets, plugged, froze, froze, died, be, be, charged, turned] [other]
After two weeks the tiny power  <i> button stopped working  <i> and the only way it would come on was to plug the player into a PC via the USB cable, so I returned it and ordered the SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip that so far works great. [stopped, working, come, was, plug, returned, ordered, works] [tiny, only, great]
PROS: - compact - inexpensive - drag and drop of files without extra software - compatible with most audio formats - decent battery life - expandable memory CONS: - small base memory - clunky interface - tiny screen - software crashes - power  <i> button stopped working <i>  - worthless headphones. [stopped, working] [compact, inexpensive, extra, compatible, most, audio, decent, expandable, small, base, clunky, tiny, worthless]
Based on some suggestion on similar but different problems, I tried to (1) reset, (2) format, (3) press the power button and hold for 15/30/60/. [Based, tried, reset, hold] [similar, different]
seconds, (4) press the power button while holding down the middle button,. [holding] [middle]
----------- Work-around for the USB non-connection:  while turned off, hold down the middle button and then connect the USB cable, and the sansa will be seen as a USB removable disk. [turned, hold, connect, be, seen] [-----------, Work-around, middle, removable]
First "player" had to be returned after 10 months from purchase cause the on/off  <i> button froze <i>  in the off position. [had, be, returned, froze] [off]
- Fourth, the home  <i> button is also on its way to no longer working <i> . [is] [Fourth, longer]
I was able to reset my Clip per instructions, but the home  <i> button does not always respond <i>  when I press it, even after resetting. [was, reset, does, respond, press, resetting] [able]
But the tuner was very poor and the on/off  <i> button broke <i>  after one month. [was, broke] [poor]
The  <i> button were a bit too sensitive <i>  and would occasionally get bumped, meaning I'd have to listen to a chapter over again, and the battery life monitor wasn't particularly accurate, often dying and shutting off when the battery was supposedly half full, but, otherwise it was fine. [were, get, bumped, meaning, have, listen, was, dying, shutting, was, was] [sensitive, accurate, half, full, fine]
I liked the layout and functions of the button on the old style Clips. [liked] [old]
The on/off button has also changed. [has, changed] [on\]
With the Clip+ there's now a simple button on the top. ['s] [simple]
The first one lasted a few days before the power  <i> button broke <i> . [lasted, broke] [first, few]
I only replaced it with the same thing because they changed the on button. [replaced, changed] [same]
Here are the reasons that I personally didn't like it: - The  <i> button are too small <i>  and positioned at a very bad place. [are, did, are, positioned] [small, bad]
Every time I want to skip to the next song, it's very frustrating trying to pinpoint exactly where the correct button is and I have small to medium size fingers. [want, skip, 's, trying, pinpoint, is, have] [next, frustrating, correct, small, medium]
This may sound dumb because you're looking at the player right now thinking, just press the button on the right side of the square. [sound, 're, looking, thinking, press] [dumb, right]
Sometimes I accidently hit other button. [hit] [other]
For example, the top button on an iPod click wheel allows you to return to the previous menu. [allows, return] [top, iPod, previous]
The bottom button pauses/starts a song. [pauses\] [bottom]
And to make that worse, the menu  <i> button does NOT bring you back <i>  to the previous screen - instead it presents a list of options - such as returning to the previous screen. [make, does, bring, presents, returning] [worse, previous, such, previous]
The button are made of a matte, textured plastic. [are, made] [textured]
Although releasing the fast forward/rewind button a slight bit and pushing back down on it will result in the Clip+ skipping to the next song. [releasing, pushing, result, skipping] [fast, slight, next]
Press down harder on the button, although its smaller size makes that a little hard. [makes] [smaller, little, hard]
The feature I most liked was that fast-forwarding accelerated the longer the button was held - which is handy if you bump the button and change tracks accidentally (which happened a lot). [liked, was, accelerated, was, held, is, bump, happened] [fast-forwarding, handy]
I pushed the next song button and the screen went black. [pushed, went] [next, black]
UPDATE: Sandisk forum suggested holding the power button down for a minute or longer. [UPDATE, suggested, holding] [longer]
In Sum: Sansa Clip is almost too small to be functional (small screen,button). [is, be] [small, functional, small]
I purchased this MP3 back in April 2010, and after seven months of general use, the up volume  <i> button broke <i> . [purchased, broke] [general]
Improvements over the original clip: - The power button is now on top of the Clip instead of along the side as it is with the original Clip - The volume control is easy to access - The menu functions are more clear - It has the expansion slot Things I prefer in the original Clip: - Ruggedness. [is, is, is, are, has, prefer] [original, original, easy, clear, original]
I prefer the round button to the square one and the brighter colors: silver, red, pink. [prefer] [red, pink]
Then the last straw was that after only 8 months of use, the power  <i> button stopped working <i> . [was, stopped, working] [last]
Then its pause  <i> button died <i>  (sigh) and the memory was full so I decided to upgrade to a 8gb. [died, was, decided, upgrade] [full, 8gb]
The placement of the power  <i> button is such that it randomly turns itself off <i> , which only makes the battery problem worse. [is, turns, makes] [such, worse]
Not that any of the button are easy to use without looking, but I just can't imagine anyone being happy with such an awful volume controller. [are, use, looking, imagine, being] [easy, happy, awful]
Next, the  <i> button are very sensitive <i> , every time I use it while doing housework or cooking it's guaranteed to touch something and press a button. [are, use, doing, 's, guaranteed, touch] [Next, sensitive]
Also, when I try to change a track and don't give this player my full attention, I will hit  <i> two button at the same time <i>  and lock the unit. [try, change, do, give, hit, lock] [full, same]
Every once and awhile I would accidentally get a button pushed, but this new design will misfire constantly with the slightest pressure. [get, pushed, misfire] [new, slightest]
So even after it would completely freeze before playing certain songs, requiring me to hold down the power button and turn the player off, I kept on telling myself to like it and give it a chance. [freeze, playing, requiring, hold, turn, kept, telling, like, give] [certain]
If I rename an album or something, sometimes it's not reflected in the Sansa clip, but I didn't want to pay $50 for an ipod shuffle where I can't see visually the name of the song playing or pay a lot for an ipod nano that didn't have button (I don't want to have to look at a screen to fast forward if I'm running). [rename, 's, reflected, did, want, pay, see, pay, did, have, do, want, have, look, 'm, running] [fast]
If it weren't for the  <i> power button issue <i> , I would recommend the Sansa clip as a good cheap alternative to the ipod, but because of this known problem, I'd invest in something better. [were, recommend, invest] [good, cheap, known]
Update: I've only had it for 8 months and the power  <i> button stopped working <i>  and since it's physical damage from a few drops it isn't covered by the warranty. ['ve, had, stopped, working, 's, is, covered] [physical, few]
One works fine, but after 6 weeks or so the other has developed a middle button that often doesn't work without repeated pressing to get it working, but the button functions OK about half the time and everything else on the player is fine, so we'll see. [works, has, developed, does, work, repeated, pressing, get, working, is, see] [other, middle, fine]
) and they can usually be brought back from the dead by resetting (hold power button down for 30 seconds or more, sometimes takes repeated attempts) and then get rid of the files to cure the dysfunction, if it's messing up more often than a few times and not just an infrequent glitch. [be, brought, resetting, hold, takes, repeated, get, rid, cure, 's, messing] [dead, more, few, infrequent]
And, switching between playlists and media while working out is not the easiest due to the configuration of the button. [switching, working, is] [easiest, due]

This last week the volume <i>  button quit working <i> . [quit, working] [last]
I like the volume button on my old one better. [like] [old, better]
If you want to plug your player in, have itunes auto start, sync all the new podcasts, remove the songs you've listened to and add different ones, sync automatically and be ready to go in five minutes or less, the extra cost for the ipod nano is well worth it It is better than the Ipd shuffle 3g (screen, external button)  but loading songs and playing them takes way longer. [want, plug, have, remove, 've, listened, add, be, go, is, is, loading, playing, takes] [new, different, ready, less, extra, worth, better, external]
Sometimes the pause  <i> button doesn't work <i> , and sometimes it suddenly stops playing while there is no physical or electrical shock on the device. [does, work, stops, is] [physical, electrical]
try press and holding the power button for more than a minute, if it doesn't work out, try the same with the lock button, and the center button, etc. [try, holding, does, work, try] [more, same]
It is very small, the button and menus are easy to use, and the sound quality is great. [is, are, use, is] [small, easy, sound, great]
I did not like current ipod shuffle design with no button on the player and hate standard ipod headphones with ipod controls. [did, hate] [current, standard]
Than I pushed really hard and the sound  <i> button imploded <i> . [pushed, imploded] [hard, sound]
The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the button are larger. [is, see, does, take, are] [small, larger]
Simple Navigation button-Took less than 5 minutes to learn. [learn] [less]
No fumbling through the other button to find pause. [fumbling, find] [other]
Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. [use, push] [Convenient]
Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. [are, trigger] [stiff]
Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. [reverse, start, speed, is, held] [more]
To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button<Settings<System Settings<USB Mode< For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode. [find, 's, loading, recognize] [simple, Audible]
What I find is that I have to hold down the power button for an inordinate amount of time, but if I'm patient, it will show me the Sansa splash screen and logo before freezing again. [find, is, have, hold, 'm, show] [inordinate, patient]
I haven't lost any data (music on the internal drive, audiobooks on the microSDHC) and it's a pain because I never know if holding down the power button will bring it back, but if I'm persistent it does. [have, lost, 's, know, holding, bring, 'm, does] [internal, persistent]
Yes, it would be nice if it showed me date and time (especially since I can set that), and I worry that the slotRadio slot isn't covered and it would be more convenient to have the volume button more accessible when it's plugged into an external power source, but it still does what I need it to do which is hold a lot of audiobooks and music that I can listen to anywhere! [be, showed, set, worry, is, covered, be, have, 's, plugged, does, need, do, is, hold, listen] [nice, convenient, accessible, external]
The volume  <i> button broke <i>  the first time. [broke] [first]
The power <i>  button broke <i>  on my most previous one. [broke] [previous]
Be warned the  <i> button are tiny <i>  so if you have larger fingers you should not get this player. [Be, warned, are, have, get] [tiny, larger]
Its power  <i> button was hard to press <i> , and later in the week it was impossible to open/close even though USP worked. [was, press, was, open\, worked] [hard, impossible]
It's easy to <i>  bump the wrong button <i>  and lose your place. ['s, bump, lose] [easy, wrong]
Anyway the volume+  <i> button became difficult <i>  after a week or so. [became] [difficult]
I guess my biggest problem is this: I wish it had a lock button. [guess, is, wish, had] [biggest, lock]
I poked and  <i> prodded every button <i>  countless times to no avail. [poked, prodded] [countless]
After about 3-4 days, they sent me a note that said "You can adjust the volume using the Volume control button on the left side of your Sansa Clip+". [sent, said, adjust, using] [left]
prolly won't have the chance so i will get another one for sure if the  <i> button wear <i>  out. [have, get, wear] [sure]
I've owned Sansa players before so I wasn't expecting much (clunky controls, easily breakable, the clip won't stay clipped to clothing), but what I wasn't expecting was for the power button to stop working in a month (so now I have to boot it by plugging it in and let it run out of charge to turn off) and randomly will stop playing until the battery wears down; the volume - (down)  <i> button stopped  <i> today. ['ve, owned, was, expecting, stay, clipped, was, expecting, was, stop, working, have, plugging, let, run, turn, stop, playing, wears, stopped] [much, clunky, breakable]
I love the design with a very easy one-touch pause-play button that is available as soon as someone walks in the room. [love, is, walks] [easy, one-touch, available]
Something else annoying - the carrying case that hooks onto the armband (which is another $30 - ridiculous), had slots for the button on a different side than my previous unit. [annoying, carrying, hooks, is, had] [ridiculous, different, previous]
So in a perfect world, I'd have to buy another case to match up the button with the slots in the neoprene casing. [have, buy, match] [perfect]
It did freeze up occasionally - but came back after some coaxing and  <i> random pressing of the button <i>  - until the last time when it just went into coma. [did, freeze, came, pressing, went] [random, last]
It says it's meant for the Sansa clip plus, but has the circular button cover, rather than the rounded off square shown in the pic, which means it was actually made for the original Sansa. [says, 's, meant, has, rounded, shown, means, was, made] [circular, square, original]
It also has a lock feature, by holding the Home button, so it won't change songs or pause in the middle of your workout. [has, holding, change] [lock]
To reset it, you PRESS and HOLD the POWER button for more than 20 seconds. [reset, PRESS, HOLD] [more]
However, now the volume  <i> button has broken <i>  and I can't listen to the music, so it's pretty much worthless. [has, broken, listen, 's] [much, worthless]
First one I bought the on/off  <i> button stopped working <i> . [bought, stopped, working] [on\]
PS If you put this in your pocket with a key or something while excersizing, it will easily bump the other item in your pocket causing the pause button to activate (which is the same as the play button). [put, excersizing, bump, causing, activate, is] [key, other, same]

if you have a lot of music) Cons: Frustrating shuffle feature, difficult user interface, small button, small screen, playlists are difficult to make The player also does the slot radio thing. [have, are, make, does] [Frustrating, difficult, small, small, difficult]
By that time, I had read about holding the power button for 20 seconds, but that didn't do any good either. [had, read, holding, did, do] [good]
Its strange, a month ago the decrease volume  <i> button broke <i>  so i had music on max when using it only so that wasn't all that great and now it just broke and won't turn on. [broke, had, using, was, broke, turn] [strange, great]
Sound quality was decent, battery life was nice, extremely convenient for working out and listening to the radio, easy button to navigate, yada yada. [was, was, working, listening, navigate] [Sound, decent, nice, convenient, easy]
Onto the bad points that has been nagging me on day one: you can't simply change folders with a press of a button. [has, been, change] [bad, nagging]
It's nice and small, but because the button and screen is bunched up together, holding it while operating the device is simply awkward and uncomfortable. ['s, is, bunched, holding, operating, is] [nice, small, awkward, uncomfortable]
I had to call customer service (India, of course, and the accent is difficult to understand) to get basic information on how to attach it to the computer (you have to push and hold the center button down before attaching it and then release the button after hooking it to the usb port. [had, call, is, understand, get, attach, have, push, hold, attaching, release, hooking] [difficult, basic]
I found that I had to play with the unit to figure out the different button. [found, had, play, figure] [different]

then the volume control button would only work in the minus direction (internal <i>  button fell off  <i> on inspection). [work, fell] [internal]

The 1st Sansa lasted a week and an half the off  <i> button broke <i>  and it would not shut off. [lasted, broke, shut] [off]
So returned it for my second and this is the SECOND night and the off  <i> button will not turn on  <i> and it won't recharge/turn on with the PC. [returned, is, turn, recharge\] [second, off]
I bought a used product, I knew this,but when it came the volume  <i> button was broken <i> ,returned it with no problems. [bought, knew, came, was, broken, returned] [used]
The  <i> button layout is also poor  <i> in comparison to the original clip - there is no longer the ability to 'lock button' - which is nice for going to the gym and not having to worry about bumping a button. [is, is, lock, is, going, having, worry, bumping] [poor, original, nice]
- I've seen nanos on collars, but having it smack chest/neck every stride doesn't sound comfortable), but they moved the volume control button to the left-side of the device - which is more inconvenient to reach with your thumb if attached to left pocket. ['ve, seen, having, smack, does, sound, moved, is, reach, attached, left] [comfortable, inconvenient]
CLIP+ PROS: - clip+ looks nice aesthetically - ability to browse by directory CLIP+ CONS: - poor build quality - weak spring means poor grip - poor button layout -  <i> no lock button <i>  functionality - similar price to original clip, but larger capacities not offered (why not? [CLIP, looks, browse, build, means, offered] [nice, poor, weak, poor, poor, similar, original, larger]
It  <i> no longer responded to the on-off button <i> and connecting it to the pc did nothing. [responded, connecting, did] [on-off]

I'll like a toggle button so I can activate repeats of a song/album etc. [like, activate] [toggle, song\]
Sometimes the on/off  <i> button would not work <i> . [work] [on\]
We expect button to work in a standard way. [expect, work] [standard]
This never, ever happened on my old player - the button had enough resistance to prevent this. [happened, had, prevent] [old, enough]
The volume and on/off button are on the sides of the case and have more resistance to accidental bumping. [are, have] [more, accidental]
The Clip+ has a sleep mode which is a fair alternative, but it takes about 10 button clicks to get to it. [has, is, takes, get] [fair]
The "back" button takes you to the start of the _previous_ track. [takes] [previous]
On my old player, I could do everything I needed to do with 2 or 3 button presses at the most. [do, needed, do] [old]
The power  <i> button spring broke  <i> and I was unable to turn the device off and on. [broke, was, turn] [unable]
There's playlist options, but that's more button pushing and organizing. ['s, 's, pushing, organizing] [more]
The new power button is fine, but moving the hold feature to a secondary action on the home  <i> button is a bit clunky <i> . [is, moving, is] [new, fine, secondary, clunky]
Hardware design issues aside, though, the home <i>  button needs to be pressed <i>  for about twice as long as it should. [needs, be, pressed] [long]
Furthermore, the error message you get when you hit a button while in a hold state takes a good 5-10 seconds to slowly scroll across the screen - A big, big step back from the 1-2 second icon and error from the old clip. [get, hit, takes, scroll] [good, 5-10, big, big, second, old]
If you're used to whacking a button on your old clip to see your current track's title or status bar, this can get incredibly aggrevating. ['re, used, whacking, see, get] [old, current, aggrevating]
The controls are simple, and require that you actually push on them like an honest-to-god button ought to work. [are, require, push, work] [simple]
After a few days, I discovered the problem: I had hit the pause button while the FM was on, causing the FM to mute. [discovered, had, hit, was, causing, mute] [few]
Within a week, I lost my music, it became unresponsive during attempts to download, the  <i> button stopped working <i>  consistantly, and then screen went black. [lost, became, stopped, working, went] [unresponsive, black]

The forward and back butons didn't work for skipping ahead to the next track, but I did find that if I held the button down hard, it would fast forward words; took longer,but doable. [did, work, skipping, did, find, held, took] [forward, next, longer, doable]
If you want to force the USB mode (which allows you to access this just a drive on a PC or Mac) what you need to do is the following: Step 1: make sure the device is turned off Step 2: hold down the center button and plug it into your PC or Mac Step 3: drag all your MP3 files into the music folder Those the steps you need to follow if you don't have to deal with software and uses one drag your music files onto the device. [want, force, allows, need, do, is, make, is, turned, hold, plug, drag, need, follow, do, have, deal, uses, files] [sure]
Pros: - small size - light weight - simplicity of design - memory expansion - MTP interface (next three items)   - drag and drop via Windows Explorer   - can create & use playlists that are simply text files with folder/file names   - ability to play by folder Cons: - the power  <i> button stopped working <i>  (I understand this is a common problem) - the headphone jack was kind of bad -- you have to keep adjusting the cord until you can get both channels - the battery indicator wasn't of much value: I could start a run with the indicator down only one notch but it would soon die Before the Clip+, I had a Fuse whose display went out, presumably from sweat damage. [create, use, are, play, stopped, working, understand, is, was, have, keep, adjusting, get, was, start, die, had, went] [small, light, next, folder\, common, bad, much]
The ON/OFF  <i> button jammed <i>  after the first week. [jammed] [first]
I thought maybe it was a problem with there being no lock for the power button, but after being very careful to make sure no button are ever pressed with transporting the clip around (for example versus it just banging around in my bag or pocket) I find I still have the problem. [thought, was, being, being, make, are, pressed, transporting, banging, find, have] [careful, sure]
I only have problems with the record function; however, I do NOT recommend you buy this product even if you have no intention of using the Vocie recorder - the power <i>  button does NOT have a hold  <i> or lock key as with the older models. [have, do, recommend, buy, have, using, does, have] [older]
They waste 2 of the 4 direct button. [waste] [direct]
Pros: Excellent features, good display, easy interface, very portable Cons: The volume  <i> button easily broke <i> . [broke] [Excellent, good, easy, portable]
I wish it were a single button or a setting that could be remembered (like the power saver function! [wish, were, be, remembered] [single]
Don't just dump several hundred songs into a single directory unless you plan to leave it on shuffle - hitting the down button a hundred times to find a specific song is tedious. [Do, dump, plan, leave, hitting, find, is] [several, single, specific, tedious]
The main problem I have with this player is that there is  <i> no LOCK KEYS button <i>  so if its in your pocket and gets bumped it will pause change tracks or just power off. [have, is, is, gets, bumped, pause] [main]
If placed on your belt near the front of your pants, which most people would have it if not on the arm, bending over can cause the cloth of your shirt or jeans to press on the power button turning the unit off. [placed, have, bending, cause, press, turning] [most]
The volume "up" <i>  button stopped functioning <i> , rendering my Sansa useless. [stopped, functioning, rendering] [useless]
It worked fine for a while, but after a month, the power  <i> button broke <i>  while sitting in a nearly empty backpack. [worked, broke, sitting] [empty]
The power  <i> button was defective <i> . [was] [defective]
Now the real issue, the volume  <i> button broke <i> . [broke] [real]
It was small, the button configurations and user interface were very similar, and my previous Sansa Clip was very durable so I made the purchase. [was, were, was, made] [small, similar, previous, durable]
Pros: Small and light Easy to use Mini-SD card slot The clip is handy for gym & work Cons: Protruding power button allows player to turn on in purse and run the battery down ***Periodically dies anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days (at decent battery %, no response to charger)*** Meh: Battery life isn't great but it's not horrible either The random dying while the battery is charged is what ruins an otherwise decent little MP3 player for me. [use, is, Protruding, allows, turn, run, dies, is, 's, dying, is, charged, is] [Small, light, Mini-SD, handy, decent, great, horrible, random, decent, little, MP3]
It will not respond to button pushing, chargers, and USB data connections, and it happens progressively more often the longer I've owned it (although the amount of time it spends "dead" is completely random). [respond, pushing, happens, 've, owned, spends, is] [dead, random]
then the other day the on/off  <i> button ceased working <i>  and nothing would get it to work again. [ceased, working, get, work] [other]
also had some trouble with the button that would move you on to the next song. [had, move] [next]
had to push the little home button and go back to the begenning of the play list. [had, push, go] [little]
-External volume button, so it's easy to adjust. ['s, adjust] [easy]
I eventually went to the Sansa site technical support and found out that you've got to hold the power button for 20 seconds. [went, found, 've, got, hold] [technical]
My power  <i> button had stopped working <i>  suddenly (no drop or physical damage). [had, stopped, working] [physical]
After carefully prying open the case, I came to find that the internal power  <i> button had popped off <i>  of the mainboard. [came, find, had, popped] [prying, open, internal]
I figured somehow I left it on and killed the battery, but when I plug it into my computer to charge it, the screen stays blank and it  <i> doesn't respond when I push the button <i> . [figured, left, killed, plug, charge, stays, does, respond, push] [blank]
During those rare moments it was working, I found the user interface  <i> difficult for both the menus and button <i> . [was, working, found] [rare, difficult]
Hit button, plugged it in, unplugged it, nothing. [Hit, plugged] [unplugged]
