Just today (2/2/12) , when I hit the lockout button, the  <i> screen went black <i>  and I was unable to revive the machine even by putting it on the usb cable. [hit, went, was, revive, putting] [black, unable]
One froze on the boot screen, the other on the main menu. [froze] [other, main]
The  <i> screen is in a 'stuck' mode <i>  and nothing I do can reset it; it won't even power off. [is, do, reset] [stuck]
When I got home I noticed even though the  <i> screen was black <i>  and I couldn't turn it on (even tried the 15 second power-button reset) the Clip+ was quite warm. [got, noticed, was, turn, tried, was] [black, second, power-button, warm]
The display  <i> screen was too small <i>  to read any song titles. [was, read] [small]
the  <i> screen was super small <i>  and i had bought this for my mom, so she had to strain to see what she was doing. [was, had, bought, had, strain, see, was, doing] [super, small]
im not sure if the one we received was defective but the  <i> screen started to fade  <i> about 2 weeks since we had it. [received, was, started, fade, had] [sure, defective]
I had the Shuffle for years and was happy with the small size, but unhappy with the lack of a screen. [had, was] [happy, small, unhappy]
The  <i> screen went dead  <i> but the little guy still worked. [went, worked] [dead, little]
The  <i> screen was still dead <i>  and yet it still played. [was, played] [dead]
Tried charging in case power was the problem, but it locked up on the "connected to the computer" screen (which  could not access from my computer. [Tried, charging, was, locked, access] [connected]
The power button stopped working on one, another one the computer can't recognize when it gets plugged in, and the other two just froze,  <i> the screen froze <i> , and the battery died and can be no longer be charged or turned on. [stopped, working, recognize, gets, plugged, froze, froze, died, be, be, charged, turned] [other]
Navigation is difficult with such a  <i> small screen <i>  and song tags do not always appear correctly (typical with most devices it seems). [is, do, appear, seems] [difficult, such, small, typical, most]
PROS: - compact - inexpensive - drag and drop of files without extra software - compatible with most audio formats - decent battery life - expandable memory CONS: - small base memory - clunky interface -  <i> tiny screen <i>  - software crashes - power button stopped working - worthless headphones. [stopped, working] [compact, inexpensive, extra, compatible, most, audio, decent, expandable, small, base, clunky, tiny, worthless]
I was initially impressed with the physical size, the song storage size, the playback quality, and even the screen color. [was, impressed] [physical, playback]
I especially liked the playlist functions, readable screen size and shuffle, even though these features are pretty standard these days. [liked, are] [readable, standard]
Still works like a charm - same sound quality as day 1, the  <i> screen has a couple of dead pixels <i>  (water damage) but no cracks, and the click wheel works great! [works, has, works] [same, sound, dead, great]
And to make that worse, the menu button does NOT bring you back to the previous screen - instead it presents a list of options - such as returning to the previous screen. [make, does, bring, presents, returning] [worse, previous, such, previous]
I use the most frugal settings - screen brightness at the lowest setting, backlight set to stay on for 5 seconds (as low as it can go). [use, set, stay, go] [frugal, lowest, low]
Second, the screen comes with a sticker covering the  <i> tiny screen  <i> which is crazy glued in place. [comes, covering, is, glued] [tiny, crazy]
Finally a razor blade (on the second device) revealed the screen behind. [revealed] [second]
Tried plugging into a rear USB and within seconds,it showed a complete charge,but  <i> nothing else on display screen <i> . [Tried, plugging, showed] [rear, complete]
I pushed the next song button and the  <i> screen went black <i> . [pushed, went] [next, black]
In Sum: Sansa Clip is almost too small to be functional ( <i> small screen <i> ,buttons). [is, be] [small, functional, small]
The color screen was not important to me, which the IRiver had. [was, had] [important]
The clock is visible on the IRiver's play screen. [is] [visible]
The <i>  screen stopped working <i> , and I was unable to do anything but push 'play', and random stuff would come up. [stopped, working, was, do, come] [unable, random]
" When I got to the screens to create an account, I was asked for credit card information and presented with the information that after a 30-day free trial, I would be charged $15/month. [got, create, was, asked, presented, be, charged] [30-day, free]
I'm embarrassed to say that I had a problem with  not removing the screen protector, it is quite thick and  <i> completely blocks out the screen  <i> when it's on. ['m, say, had, removing, is, 's] [embarrassed, thick]
I was afraid of damaging  the screen when I tried to remove it. [was, damaging, tried, remove] [afraid]
battery was only at 50% the last time i checked,  <i> screen is blank <i>  and unresponsive. [was, checked, is] [last, blank, unresponsive]
My san disc worked great for five months , then stopped working entirely with the  <i> screen frozen <i> . [worked, stopped, working, frozen] [great]
Display  <i> screen had odd color spots <i>  that tended to move around, and menu controls didn't work at all. [had, tended, move, did, work] [odd]
The pros of this device are fairly self evident: small size, bright OLED screen, FM radio, microSDHC, and so on, so I'll focus on what *doesn't* work well. [are, focus, does] [evident, small, bright]
The unit is very small, so the text on the  <i> screen is very tiny <i> . [is, is] [small, tiny]
Stopped working with  <i> frozen screen  <i> and no clue as to how to get help. [working, get] [frozen]
If I rename an album or something, sometimes it's not reflected in the Sansa clip, but I didn't want to pay $50 for an ipod shuffle where I can't see visually the name of the song playing or pay a lot for an ipod nano that didn't have buttons (I don't want to have to look at a screen to fast forward if I'm running). [rename, 's, reflected, did, want, pay, see, pay, did, have, do, want, have, look, 'm, running] [fast]
It started telling me I needed to free up space, then would promptly shut down on its own (except it didn't really shut down, it was still using battery power with a  <i> blank screen <i> ). [started, telling, needed, free, shut, did, shut, was, using] [own, blank]
, video, touch screen, web browser) but play music, this is perfect. [play, is] [perfect]
The <i>  screen is too small <i>  to effectively select songs while your training. [is, select] [small]
If you want to plug your player in, have itunes auto start, sync all the new podcasts, remove the songs you've listened to and add different ones, sync automatically and be ready to go in five minutes or less, the extra cost for the ipod nano is well worth it It is better than the Ipd shuffle 3g (screen, external buttons)  but loading songs and playing them takes way longer. [want, plug, have, remove, 've, listened, add, be, go, is, is, loading, playing, takes] [new, different, ready, less, extra, worth, better, external]
And the screen is 1000% better, and battery life 24 hrs instead of 15. [is] [better]
My last one still works even though the  <i> screen is broken <i> . [works, is, broken] [last]
The  <i> screen is small <i>  enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger. [is, see, does, take, are] [small, larger]
What I find is that I have to hold down the power button for an inordinate amount of time, but if I'm patient, it will show me the Sansa splash screen and logo before freezing again. [find, is, have, hold, 'm, show] [inordinate, patient]
It's easy to navigate the screen and import your songs. ['s, navigate] [easy]
To protect the player, I just put regular clear packing tape over the screen and put black duct tape over the microsd slot once the card was in place. [protect, put, put, was] [regular, clear, black]
The screen timeout is pretty short which helps a little but doesn't solve the problem. [is, helps, does, solve] [short, little]
The clip was sturdy, the screen was easy to read, and the sound quality was fantastic. [was, was, read, was] [sturdy, easy, sound, fantastic]
In the middle of a song, the <i>  screen went black <i>  and the sound went dead. [went, went] [black, dead]
Brand new out of the box-the menu <i>  screen doesn't work <i>  at all, the device shows as being "critically low" on battery power when attached to the computer, but will not charge. [does, work, shows, being, attached, charge] [new, box-the, low]
I owned the e260 and I broke the screen on the first one after about a year so I bought another one and it got stolen about after a year. [owned, broke, bought, got, stolen] [e260, first]
First, it was just hard to see the screen (the blue display got really dim) then it became impossible to see anything and finally, it turned black and I could see nothing. [was, see, got, became, see, turned, see] [hard, blue, impossible, black]
LED screen very visible. [LED] [visible]
However, the resultant  <i> screen size is a serious negative <i>  when it comes to reading titles of songs or audio books, not to mention menu items. [is, comes, reading, mention] [resultant, serious, negative, audio]
In light of its "crazy" internal structure and the time that it takes to find folders, and a frankly too  <i> small screen <i> , I have given this otherwise excellent player two stars. [takes, find, have, given] [crazy, internal, small, excellent]
However, after many frustrating experiences with its  <i> tiny screen  <i> and absolutely the most user-unfriendly menu of any device that I have used, I "upgraded" to a Sony S544 player. [have, used, upgraded] [many, frustrating, tiny, user-unfriendly]
I'm on my 6th one and I just recharged it and now it is completely frozen with the power on and the screen lit up. ['m, recharged, is, frozen, lit] [6th]
if you have a lot of music) Cons: Frustrating shuffle feature, difficult user interface, small buttons, <i>  small screen <i> , playlists are difficult to make The player also does the slot radio thing. [have, are, make, does] [Frustrating, difficult, small, small, difficult]
For the purpose of what I wanted it for it was perfect--small, light, easy to use, it didn't have any screens to mess with. [wanted, was, use, did, have] [perfect, small, light, easy]
It's nice and small, but because the buttons and screen is bunched up together, holding it while operating the device is simply awkward and uncomfortable. ['s, is, bunched, holding, operating, is] [nice, small, awkward, uncomfortable]
- I hate the touchscreen/ touchpad on devices- there are so hard to precisely control. [hate, are, control] [touchscreen, hard]
Furthermore, the error message you get when you hit a button while in a hold state takes a good 5-10 seconds to slowly scroll across the screen - A big, big step back from the 1-2 second icon and error from the old clip. [get, hit, takes, scroll] [good, 5-10, big, big, second, old]
No frippery or gewgaws, no infuriating 'touch-screen" control that require a deft touch for the simplest commands, no falling apart within a few months. [infuriating, require, falling] [touch-screen, simplest, few]
I couldn't  <i> see the screen  <i> when outside. [see] [outside]
that was until I went for a run that (first night with it) night, about 1 hour into my run it stopped sounding, it was on, the screen was working but no sound. [was, went, stopped, sounding, was, was, working] [first]
It's easy to forget that it's on because the  <i> screen will go black <i>  when not in use. ['s, forget, 's, go] [easy, black]
The Sansa was a bit hard to understand the downloading of music from my PC and to understand the menu on the  <i> small screen <i>  is impossible. [was, understand, understand, is] [hard, small, impossible]
The menu is as easy as you could expect, given that the small  <i> screen cannot display  <i> more than three lines at a time. [is, expect, given, display] [easy, small, more]
(Though be warned, the  <i> screen is hard <i>  to see in direct sunlight. [be, warned, is, see] [hard, direct]
Within a week, I lost my music, it became unresponsive during attempts to download, the buttons stopped working consistantly, and then  <i> screen went black <i> . [lost, became, stopped, working, went] [unresponsive, black]
After a couple of years of the same treatment the Sansa recieved, the player still works, even with a  <i> cracked screen <i> . [recieved, works, cracked] [same]
However, after about 20 days the  <i> screen started to get weird <i> . [started, get] [weird]
It started like something was burned into the screen, then day 40 the  <i> screen completely died <i> , which as you can imagine makes life very difficult if you wish to do anything with it. [started, was, burned, died, imagine, wish, do] [difficult]
* screen: not visible in sun, better remove it altogether from a sports player and thus extend the batt life, lower price and size. [remove, extend] [visible, better, lower]
The pc can't see it when it's plugged in, the logo  <i> screen doesn't come on <i> , it's just dead. [see, 's, plugged, does, come, 's] [dead]
The screen is wasy enough to read, if I hold it within a foot of my face (I could read my Fuse from further away). [is, read, hold, read] [wasy, further]
The first thing I noticed was I was unable to adjust the screen brightness as far down as I wanted. [noticed, was, was, adjust, wanted] [first, unable]
I had just looked at the screen a few seconds before it died to change the volume, and saw that I still had half a charge left. [had, looked, died, change, saw, had, left] [few]
I love the screen, the size, the price, the features, and the sound quality. [love] [sound]
I will try to use it the next day (no playing in between), but instead of a full charge the battery symbol shows the lowest readout and the unit will barely play before shutting off with a "low battery" screen. [try, use, shows, play, shutting] [next, full, lowest, low]
I keep the LED screen light set for very short duration and volume at a moderate level and I never got close to 15 hours. [keep, set, got] [short, moderate]
I bought my daughter a "clip" a couple years ago, and recently her  <i> screen went dead  <i> (not uncommon). [bought, went] [dead, uncommon]
I'm sure the battery is very small, since the whole player is, but the screen is mostly off and the player does not do anything fancy. ['m, is, is, is, does, do] [sure, small, whole, off, fancy]
1-inch colored screen instead. [colored] [1-inch]
I figured somehow I left it on and killed the battery, but when I plug it into my computer to charge it, the  <i> screen stays blank <i>  and it doesn't respond when I push the buttons. [figured, left, killed, plug, charge, stays, does, respond, push] [blank]
(you can hack an Ipod so it works with Windows just like an external hard drive without having to install the Itunes virus) I thought it would be nice to have a screen. [hack, works, having, install, thought, be, have] [external, hard, nice]
After using this device for only a few hours (I only charged the battery once) it  <i> crashed on the splash screen <i> . [using, charged, crashed] [few]
Sure the screen could be bigger, but then it would be, uh, bigger; and I have no use for the music card function (adding, for me, an extra menu to be flipped through on my way from FM to Audio and back). [be, be, have, adding, be, flipped] [Sure, bigger, bigger, extra]
Worked great,  <i> little screen <i> , ability to listen to radio as well, etc. [listen] [Worked, great, little]
