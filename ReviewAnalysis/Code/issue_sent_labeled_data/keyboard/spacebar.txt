It would make too much sense to make the spacebar a split-button that can be pressed on either side of the curve, but for some reason Microsoft doesn't always deal in common sense. [make, make, be, pressed, does, deal] [much, common]
The biggest issue is that there is a bit of  <i> play in the spacebar <i> , so you have to get accustomed to pushing through that first bit, then really whacking it to get the space you wanted. [is, is, have, get, accustomed, pushing, whacking, get, wanted] [biggest, first]

As others have mentioned here, this keyboard is great with one exception - the spacebar! [have, mentioned, is] [great]

[search, _, see, is, does, occur, have, do, have, tried, are] [common, various, various, satisfactory]
Maybe a two-finger "hunt and peck" typist wouldn't notice this, but for this touch typist the problematic/defective  <i> spacebar is a dealbreaker <i> . [peck, notice, is] [two-finger, problematic\]

I'm largely happy with this keyboard but will note several caveats: * The media keys do not provide next/previous track keys * The elevating skirt to raise the front edge of the keyboard is awkward to add/remove and is cheaply constructed * The keys are quite responsive but are a bit louder than I think they need to be, particularly the spacebar Ergonomically this is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used.
