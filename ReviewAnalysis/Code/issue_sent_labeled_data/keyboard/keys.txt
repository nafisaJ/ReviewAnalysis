the same one I bought a few years ago: The  <i> keys are much louder  <i> on this one and also not as soft to the touch. [bought, are] [same, few, much, soft]
Just discovered this, that this keyboard's  <i> keys is prone to failure <i> . [discovered, is] [prone]
And she bought a new one, same model, and that too,  <i> keys started failing <i> . [bought, started, failing] [new, same]
Of all things about a keyboard, if the  <i> keys start to fail <i> , it's the worst. [start, fail, 's] [worst]
Was able to install anyways only to discover that several  <i> keys didn't work <i> . [Was, install, discover, did, work] [able, several]
I was looking for a keyboard with backlighted keys. [was, looking] [backlighted]
I received it and it is NOT visible in poor lighting, despite the claim of the big white lettered keys! [received, is, lettered] [visible, poor, big, white]
Great little device, but a number of the normal keyboard  <i> keys are either missing  <i> or missing functionality. [are, missing, missing] [little, normal]
The other problem I have with this keyboard is that the "J", "U", "H"  <i> keys sometimes do not work <i> . [have, is, keys, do, work] [other]
I  <i> had to hit those keys harder  <i> to ensure those keys work. [had, hit, ensure, work] [harder]
As any new keyboard there's a learning curve and it takes a little time to get used to and find the keys, however I still today  <i> constantly miss keys  <i> nd though I really like some of the other functions am contemplating going back to the ugly cream coloured ergo board. ['s, learning, takes, get, used, find, miss, am, contemplating, going, colored] [new, little, other, ugly]
I'm giving this keyboard one star because ultimately a keyboard primarily  <i> needs to have keys that are comfortable for me  <i> to use and don't impede my input. ['m, giving, needs, have, are, use, do, impede] [comfortable]
I found the keys on this keyboard to be way too "spongey", meaning that the  <i> keys press down quite a ways  <i> then don't spring right back up. [found, be, meaning, press, do, spring] [spongey]
I found myself  <i> having to press the keys harder <i> , and that would then slow down the next key press. [found, having, press, slow] [next, key]
I've owned three of these, and all have at least 2  <i> keys that don't work  <i> without having to bang hard on them. ['ve, owned, have, do, work, having] [least]
If you spill any amount of liquid on this keyboard whatosoever, individual  <i> keys will stop responding  <i> within minutes and you'll need a replacement. [spill, stop, responding, need] [individual]
The keys work smoothly and have some hot keys, however I will never use some of them on the Mac so I cannot comment on the keyboard's full potential. [work, have, use, comment] [hot, full]
Was really excited about having a compact keyboard with backlit keys for my home media center, but the range proved to be a problem. [Was, excited, having, proved, be] [compact, backlit]
It has been widely reported and I will confirm: The N key is wider than the other keys (to fill in space) and the mechanical trigger for the key is in the center rather than towards the right where you typically hit the key. [has, been, reported, confirm, is, fill, is, hit] [wider, other, mechanical]
It works (connects easily and every time) and it's nice to have the laptop style trackpad built-in, unfortunately the  <i> keys are cramped  <i> for serious typing. [works, connects, 's, have, are, cramped] [nice, laptop, serious]
On my first one the left Ctrl key, the letter V, and the  <i> comma keys all died <i> . [keys, died] [first]
First the  <i> keys went "soft"  <i> where they were visibly sunken down and felt less clicky & springy, and then one day they just no longer worked. [went, were, felt, worked] [soft, sunken, clicky, longer]
The media keys at the top are nice, and you can customize them a fair bit when you install the Intellikey software. [are, customize, install] [nice, fair]
Things you should consider: Microsoft uses an "F-lock" key design, where the F  <i> keys along the top are not enabled  <i> until you hit the F-lock button. [consider, uses, are, enabled, hit] [key]
MS keyboards (especially this one) are very wide and use a ton of space to the right of the arrow keys, mainly for the number pad. [are, use] [wide]
The keys feel nice and are pretty quiet. [feel, are] [nice, quiet]
I like that you can create your own shortcuts for each of the top function keys, and the zoom and back/forward buttons are nice to have (though the back/forward buttons are too far down and my mouse already has those). [like, create, are, have, are, has] [own, top, nice, back\]
Just plugging the receiver the keyboard started work right away, which is good, but not with full functionality: the grey function  <i> keys at the top are not functional <i> , and the mouse click wheel button is not functional. [plugging, started, is, are, is] [good, full, gray, functional, functional]
The keyboard is much smaller (and as a result less ergonomic)  - they have managed to do this because the  <i> keys are smaller  <i> and placed closer together (especially the arrow keys! [is, have, managed, do, are, placed, keys] [smaller, ergonomic, smaller]
The page up and down keys use to be by themselves and now have an insert key right next to them which is annoying. [use, be, have, is, annoying] [key, right, next]
the one i received did not have a sticker on the box and the  <i> keys were hard  <i> plastic. [received, did, have, were] [hard]
You need really big hands and really long fingers to be able to reach all the number keys. [need, be, reach] [big, long, able]
The  <i> keys are very slippery  <i> and my fingers were constantly sliding off them. [are, were, sliding] [slippery]
And if you like to lower the lights while you're browsing the web, you'll be constantly holding the keyboard up to the light because the  <i> keys are not backlit <i> . [like, lower, 're, browsing, be, holding, are] [backlit]
Well, to my surprise, it does take an unexpectedly strong stroke to get a space compared to the other keys. [does, take, get, compared] [strong, other]
The other "extra"  <i> keys haven't gotten much use  <i> yet, but as I ramp up the keyboard's use for work -- and Excel -- I think I'll really like the extra numeric keypad keys (parens and equals). [have, gotten, think, like, equals] [other, extra, much, extra, numeric]
I was typing on a phone call and I realized that it was literally difficult to hear my colleague over the "din" of my keystrokes. [was, typing, realized, was, hear] [difficult]
Sadly, even the letter  <i> keys are also far too hard  <i> to depress. [are, depress] [hard]
but the  <i> keys get rubbed off  <i> during normal use after only a few months. [get, rubbed] [normal, few]
The touchpad is not functional and  <i> keys appear to stick  <i> or just don't respond at all. [is, appear, stick, do, respond] [functional]
Now I have 3 defective keyboards because some  <i> keys do not register  <i> (M, N, Caps are common). [have, do, register, are] [defective, common]
Both Alt, both Ctrl, left Shift, and a whole lot of  <i> keys don't work <i> . [left, do, work] [whole]
As a programmer, I can't stand that they changed the layout of the center row (ins, del, pgup, pgdn), slowing me down considerably, as well as the arrow keys (too small &amp; awkward). [stand, changed, slowing] [small, awkward]
(with 10 days of vacation in the midst) and already four of the  <i> keys have the printing nearly worn off <i> . [have] [worn]
Pros: - perfect ergonomics - nice leather wrist padding Cons: - noisy spacebar - spacebar presses harder then letter keys - F-keys devided into two groups, while classically it should be three - a bit large Could be perfect without issue with spacebar. [devided, be, be] [perfect, nice, noisy, large, perfect]
However, I have had multiple times that groups of  <i> keys stop working  <i> or single keys will hang giving me a string of single key inputs. [have, had, stop, working, hang, giving] [multiple, single, single, key]
Alternate  <i> on again, off again keys  <i> ZXCV and ENTER. [keys] [Alternate]
This was so they could squeeze in the up/down/left/right arrow keys into the layout they wanted. [was, squeeze, wanted] [right]
Will someone inform this keyboard manufacturer that directional keys are very rarely used, but the shift key is used QUITE OFTEN. [inform, are, used, is, used] [directional]
The noise was exacerbated by the fact that the other keys are remarkably quiet, so the sound becomes even more annoying. [was, exacerbated, are, becomes] [other, quiet, sound, annoying]
I now have the Adesso Tru-Form Media, on which the  <i> keys are slightly louder  <i> but since the sound is uniform you don't notice it once you get into the rhythm. [have, are, is, do, notice, get] [uniform]
One clue is that the System Profiler claimed to be able to see the device when the USB dongle was plugged in even though the computer  <i> stopped responding to keystrokes  <i> or the touchpad. [is, claimed, be, see, was, plugged, stopped, responding] [able]
They <i>  keys don't have a good feel <i> . [do, have] [good]
And worst, the layout of the other keys outside of the main qwerty area of the keyboard, specifically the cursor key, is just a terrible layout for anyone who has used a keyboard regularly at any time in the past 40 years. [is, has, used] [worst, other, main, terrible, past]
Certain  <i> keys became nonfunctional  <i> and the majority of the rest of the keys typed a letter or symbol other than what it was supposed to be. [became, typed, was, supposed, be] [Certain, nonfunctional, other]
As stated in many of the other reviews, the displacement of the arrow keys and the 6 navigation keys is VERY unnerving. [stated, is] [many, other, unnerving]
I use the mouse as little as possible and  <i> not having the keys  <i> where I'm used to them is not a good thing. [use, having, 'm, used, is] [little, possible, good]
It has all the necessary short cut keys and was easy to set up. [has, was, set] [necessary, short, easy]
3 days after purchasing this keyboard and a few of the <i>  keys stopped working properly <i> . [purchasing, stopped, working] [few]
At first most of the  <i> keys were jumbled up <i> so whenever I would type something it was displayed wrong on my computer screen for instance if I hit the 6 button on the numeric keypad it would display. [were, jumbled, was, displayed, hit, display] [first, most, wrong, numeric]
Full-size keys are easy to press. [are] [Full-size, easy]
The keys are responsive and types just fine. [are] [responsive, fine]
I just wish the  <i> keys were a little easier to depress <i> . [wish, were, depress] [little, easier]
I have average sized hands and I always felt like I had to stretch to reach the number and function keys. [have, sized, felt, had, stretch, reach] [average]
Also, occasionally the Function key modifier would get stuck off and the Function  <i> keys would no longer work <i> . [get, stuck, work] [key]
It was a really stupid feature to overload the function keys with yet another key. [was, keys] [stupid]
I spilled a very small amount of coffee on this keyboard (probably less than a teaspoon) and several  <i> keys now fail to function <i> . [spilled, fail, function] [small, several]
The second one was terrible, several  <i> keys are really sticky <i> --they don't bounce back right away, and the Space bar is the worst of them all. [was, are, do, bounce, is] [second, terrible, several, sticky, worst]
UPDATE: After two months of using this keyboard, more  <i> keys stopped working <i> . [UPDATE, using, stopped, working] [more]
Like other users have said the  <i> keys are not very responsive <i>  especially the space bar. [have, said, are] [other, responsive]
Misses too many keystrokes, and the buttons are laid out in a perfect smashed grid, so you won't be able to type as fast. [Misses, are, laid, smashed, be] [many, perfect, able, fast]
Also is missing several function  <i> keys that make it hard  <i> to use keyboard shortcuts. [is, missing, make, use] [several, hard]
Has some but not all "F" keys and a dedicated Ctrl+Alt+Del key Cons: Placement of the touchpad is OK but seems to hinder your typing some, Touchpad not very responsive with sensitivity all the way up. [Has, is, seems, hinder, typing] [dedicated, key, OK, responsive]
Certain keys (2, 4, T and some others) simply don't work any more. [do, work] [Certain, more]
Fortunately I prefer to use the arrow keys and enter inside Boxee so really it ends up being a non-issue. [prefer, use, enter, ends, being] [non-issue]
If you try one in store, that  <i> wiggle in the keys  <i> is not from buy-nothing kids repeatedly pounding on it with their fists for months. [try, is, pounding] [buy-nothing]
This however blocks the internal antenna and  <i> cause keystrokes to be missed <i> . [blocks, be, missed] [internal]
The reason I would like to give it negative stars is that the printing on the  <i> keys is disappearing  <i> with less than 6 months of use. [like, give, is, is, disappearing] [negative, less]
Just for comparison's sake, I have a very standard beige keyboard that has  <i> keys in almost as bad a condition  <i> as this one. [have, has] [standard, beige, bad]
I do not know if this is a function of whatever they are using to put white print on black keys or just cheap junk manufacturing. [do, know, is, are, using, put] [white, black, cheap]
The design is good but the feel of the  <i> keys is poor <i> . [is, is] [good, poor]
Additionally, some  <i> keys are easier to depress  <i> than others which interferes with typing. [are, depress, interferes, typing] [easier]
However, sometime I have to make an extra effort to  <i> punch the keys  <i> for the letter to show up on the screen and the location of the right-side shift key is "off" from the full-sized keyboard, which leaves me pressing the page up key a lot. [have, make, punch, show, is, leaves, pressing] [extra, right-side, full-sized]
However, there's one glaring flaw that isn't apparent until you've used the keyboard full time for 2-3 years: The letters/symbols on the  <i> keys wear off over time <i> . ['s, is, 've, used, wear] [apparent, full]
It's disappointing that something so simple could limit the usable life of a keyboard (without buying some stickers to put on top of the naked keys. ['s, limit, buying, put] [disappointing, simple, usable, naked]
This IS a problem because you'll be filling out a long form or doing extensive work in a browser and all of a sudden you'll go back a page and lose the data when you barely miss the spacebar and  <i> hit one of those keys  <i> instead. [IS, be, filling, doing, go, lose, miss, hit] [long, extensive, sudden]
Without having spilled liquids in the keyboard, getting it full of food crumbs, or physically damaging it, I've noticed that some  <i> keys stick <i> . [having, spilled, getting, damaging, 've, noticed, stick] [full]
If I try relaxing, I often  <i> press keys in the wrong order  <i> or miss them. [try, relaxing, press, miss] [wrong]
The F-keys are convex and even stiffer. [are] [convex, stiffer]
The volume controls and extra function keys are nice, but I wish it wasn't so big and bulky. [are, wish, was] [extra, nice, big, bulky]
It's useless when  <i> keys stop working <i> , and really annoying when one moment it was working fine and in the middle of your email, the "C" key stops working or the right shift stops working. ['s, stop, working, annoying, was, working, working, stops, working] [useless, key, right]
First, the good: keypress sounds are quiet, the weird key shapes did a very good job of making it easier for my hands to each the keys on each side, and installation was flawless (I didn't even have to install the software). [are, did, making, was, did, have, install] [good, quiet, weird, key, good, easier, flawless]
The  <i> keys have quite a mushy feel <i> ; definitely not a good choice for heavy duty writers or coders. [have] [mushy, good, heavy]
The same thing holds for several other keys. [holds] [same, several, other]
It will then relay anywhere from none to all of the keystrokes in rapid succession to the computer (resulting in it spazzing out for a few seconds as it does the things you told it to. [relay, resulting, spazzing, does, told] [rapid, few]
THe Bad:  The  <i> keys are too small <i> , touchad is on right side of keyboard. [are, is] [small, right]
These keyboards suffer from poor quality (made in China like everything else these days) and I've got a stack of bad ones sitting beside me that have to be thrown out due to  <i> non-functioning keys <i> . [suffer, made, 've, got, stack, sitting, have, be, thrown] [poor, bad, due, non-functioning]
It is fine except to one thing - after writing one book with it the E, D, S, and C  <i> keys are nearly blank <i> . [is, writing, are] [fine, blank]
The  <i> keys don't have the tactile feedback  <i> of even the basic free keyboard bundled with new computers. [do, have, bundled] [tactile, basic, free, new]
Pros ++ Keyboard installs itself on Vista or later and all extra keys work with the basic drivers ++ Key layout is curved slightly, good for those who don't want a full split keyboard ++ Integrated number pad is a nice extra for a budget keyboard ++ Quiet key action will suit those who don't like loud "clicky" keyboards ++ CTRL Shortcuts are starred under common keys like x, c, v, b, u, I, & f, making this a good learning keyboard ++ Additional extra keys include the normal function keys, back, forward, music controls and 3 extras (web/home, search & mail) ++ There's even a calculator shortcut button built-in ++ Keyboard's lower profile is much thinner than most ergonomic keyboards ++ Lowest cost in an ergonomic keyboard makes this an option for those on a budget Cons -- Plastic body is noticeably cheap --  <i> Keys have little tactile feedback <i> , making this unpleasant to use for longer periods -- Not curved enough for those who prefer full split ergonomic designs -- Keys are sticker prints that will eventually wear off (typical of low cost keyboards) -- High failure rates (also typical of low cost keyboards ALTERNATIVES It's a challenge to find decent results with ergonomic or split keyboards in this price range.

And if you like your keys to have a little bounce to them, you will likely be disappointed by this keyboard as well. [have, be, disappointed] [little]
The programmable keys are a nice feature. [are] [programmable, nice]
All the other  <i> keys are soft  <i> and take little effort to strike. [are, take, strike] [other, soft, little]
cons: - The  <i> keys are quieter  <i> on this model, but slightly harder to depress causing a minor slow down. [are, depress, causing] [harder, minor, slow]
- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the  <i> keys are physically separated  <i> into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal. [Compared, has, note, are, separated, be] [other, Ergonomic, ergonomic, minimal]
- As an avid gamer favoring the right side of the keyboard (arrow keys instead of the WASD configuration) I enjoyed the ample room around the former. [favoring, enjoyed] [avid, right, ample, former]
- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers) Now, THE BAD: - For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT keys are too small! [liked, hated, finding, closing, are] [extra, top, small]
I could do with regular sized "H" and "N" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER. [do, sized, keys, mean] [regular]
- The Media  <i> keys on top do not sit well <i>  in their homings and are not perfectly aligned. [do, sit, are, aligned] [top]
<p>But, if you are a touch-typist and your fingers already know where the keys are supposed to be, then you'll be greatly disappointed and/or frustrated with this Natural Keyboard Elite. [are, know, are, supposed, be, be] [touch-typist, disappointed, frustrated, Natural]
I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller squished-together arrow keys. [agree, regarding, changed] [other, negative, smaller, smaller]
The only great thing this board has going for it is the slight curve of the keys, though it is hardly noticeable, unlike the split ergonomic boards. [has, going, is, is] [only, great, slight, noticeable, ergonomic]
All (home, arrows, etc) keys are in a very standard layout for a full-size keyboard. [are] [standard, full-size]
It was almost a better keyboard than all the rest, BUT - It is less bent than the earlier natural keyboards - - - unless you are tiny, your wrists won't be straight - the home-end-pgup-pgdn key group are changed again - - - back to 2 rows of 3 keys - - - if you just relearned the 3 rows of 2 keys layout, this is really bad - the left corner of the wrist rest is cut way too close - - - if you have big hands the edge digs into your hand - miserable! [was, is, are, be, are, changed, relearned, is, left, is, cut, have, digs] [better, bent, earlier, natural, tiny, straight, key, bad, close, big, miserable]
- the  <i> rows of keys are FLAT <i>  - - - you must prop your wrists up high - - - - so you don't hit the key below the one you want - - - - BUT adding a wrist rest hides the LED's for caplock, etc - - - - - and blocks the back & forward buttons - the cord exits right on the edge - - don't let it land on edge - the cord will be severely bent - - - I lost a Natural MM KB with a cord like this - - - - (Natural Pro recessed the cord exit, no risk of bent cord). [are, prop, do, hit, want, adding, hides, do, let, land, be, lost, recessed] [high, key, back, bent, Natural, Natural, bent]
There are lots of bells and whistles such as programmable keys and the sort, but these are more of a gimmick than anything else. [are, are] [such, programmable, more]
The key response and placement are ok, but it's easy to mistype because of the angle of the keys. [are, 's, mistype] [key, easy]
It has a nice wrist cushion, but overall, the feel of the keys, the unwieldy over-sized footprint, and  <i> flimsy keys  <i> don't add up to a very good typing experience. [has, do, add] [nice, unwieldy, over-sized, flimsy, good]
The keys were very quiet and smooth. [were] [quiet, smooth]
It had many convenient shortcut keys which I could reprogram for my own custom purpose. [had, reprogram] [many, convenient, own]
It never worked again; most of the  <i> keys did not work <i> . [worked, did] [most]
The reason for this appears to be that there is not one solid plastic piece under the keys. [appears, be, is] [solid]
If you remove some keys, you can see the contacts inside, so if you get a little bit of water on it, it will drip straight down and ruin the entire thing. [remove, see, get, drip, ruin] [little, entire]
Someone suggested removing all the keys and spraying some rubbing alcohol down there to help any excess water evaporate out. [suggested, removing, spraying, rubbing, help, evaporate] [excess]
It's not a bad keyboard, but I've been using it for work for about a year and the first think that annoys me is that the letters on the  <i> keys wear off <i> . ['s, 've, been, using, think, is, wear] [bad, first]
On this keyboard it's easy to  <i> type multiple keys  <i> on accident (I find it happens more often with passwords) due to the sloppy feel of the keyboard. ['s, find, happens] [easy, multiple, due, sloppy]
Second, it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room, they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key! [looks, decided, was, split, had, change, are] [extra, few, lettered, middle, normal]
Add this to the fact that the  <i> keys feel "squishy"  <i> and you've got one crazy typing experience. [Add, feel, 've, got, typing] [squishy, crazy]
I really did try to get use to this, but I kept finding myself  <i> pressing incorrect keys <i> , or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key. [did, try, get, use, kept, finding, pressing, having, look, make, hit] [incorrect, sure, right]
The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch. [are] [large, hot, nice]
Cons: - The tiny plastic feet are useless - Some letters on keyboard are larger than others (annoying) -  <i> Keys feel way too soft <i>  and offer no feedback - Missing extra media controls While this keyboard may be "comfortable" and looks nice, it's just not practical for daily use if the feet break, the  <i> keys feel strange <i> , and it slows down your typing experience. [are, are, feel, Missing, be, looks, 's, feel, slows, typing] [tiny, plastic, useless, larger, soft, extra, comfortable, nice, practical, daily, strange]
I had an older version of this keyboard, and the keys on the old keyboard are closer together, or for some reason, just easier to depress. [had, are, depress] [older, old, easier]
The  <i> spacing of the keys on this keyboard seems too large <i>  (? [seems] [large]
The  <i> keys are loud <i> . [are] [loud]
The first one lasted 3 years, before several  <i> keys started refusing to respond <i> --even with extra pressure. [lasted, started, refusing, respond] [first, several, extra]
it's a pity, they didn't take a lesson on how to make keys from the old IBM keyboards from early 1980's. ['s, did, take, make] [old, early]
Its size is a bit larger than I'm accustomed to, the  <i> keys do not accept double letters <i>  and make me hit the same key three to four times to get two f's or two l'l or two anything, and the spacebar has to be hammered to work, but all in all, things were working out. [is, 'm, do, accept, make, hit, get, has, be, hammered, work, were, working] [larger, accustomed, double, same, key, l']
Granted, most people won't need them, but if you're a programmer, then having arrow  <i> keys chopped in half  <i> and shoved into a non-standard configuration is a major shortcoming. [Granted, need, 're, having, chopped, shoved, is] [most, non-standard, major]
Buy an ergonomic keyboard with standard-sized and configured arrow keys. [Buy] [ergonomic, standard-sized, configured]
MS did some things right: It's in black (gone are the days of the beige box), power user keys a re included, the keyboard now has a base tilt, and finally rest pad. [did, 's, gone, are, keys, included, has] [black, beige]
The "T" and "G"  <i> keys are consistently larger  <i> than the elite (The elite T&G keys are technically the same size as the 4000 series, but are raised in such a way that typists may need to get used to the new feel of these keys). [are, are, are, raised, need, get, used] [larger, same, such, new]
The right windows key (between the "alt" and "menu" hot-keys in line with the space bar) is now gone. [is, gone] [right, key]
The function keys now have presets (optional) 4. [have] [optional]
There are now silver hot keys at the top for 5 programmable functions and several other keys for standard windows functions such as e-mail, home directory, zoom, mute, increase/decrease volume, play/pause, and calculator 5. [are] [silver, hot, programmable, several, other, standard, such, mute, increase\]
The keys had just the right feel, and the quality was excellent. [had, was] [right, excellent]
This popular keyboard is famous for having  <i> keys suddenly stop working <i> , work intermittently or different keys work at intermittent times. [is, having, stop, working, work, work] [popular, famous, different, intermittent]
If you look closely at the arrow keys, "Insert", "Home", "Delete", and "End" keys you will see that the keys are smaller and arranged differently than a standard keyboard. [look, Insert, Delete, see, are, arranged] [smaller, standard]
The numeric key pad and the regular typewriter keys are fine. [are] [numeric, key, regular, fine]
In summary: Pro: Ergonomics are good Typewriter keys and numeric keypad are fine Con: arrow keys and navigation keys are too small and in a non-standard position keyboard is wobbly and little flimsy  <i> keys are a little mushy  <i> when pressed. [are, are, are, is, are, pressed] [good, numeric, fine, small, non-standard, wobbly, little, flimsy, little, mushy]
That keyboard's been through hell and is really showing its age in the form of lots of friction and loud keys. [been, is, showing] [loud]
The keys are reasonably quiet. [are] [quiet]
I felt like it needed more tilt and angle to the keys, but otherwise was a reasonable keyboard. [felt, needed, was] [more, reasonable]
I do wish they had kept the editing keys and dispensed with the num pad altogether so that the keyboard wouldn't take up so much desk space. [do, wish, had, kept, dispensed, take] [much]
I simply could not find the break, but there definitely was one in the flex circuit because all the other keys worked. [find, was, worked] [other]
pros: Decent product, works, has plenty of hot keys. [works, has] [Decent, hot]
The  <i> keys are very hard to press <i>  - within 1 minute of typing, I am already feeling cramps in my hands. [are, am, feeling] [hard]
I have both the old kind (arrow keys in an inverted-T shape) and a new kind (arrow keys in a cross pattern) This keyboard had inherent problems with Windows NT 4. [have, had] [old, inverted-T, new, inherent]
0 (certain  <i> keys would not work properly <i> ) and the keyboard feels cheap. [work, feels] [certain, cheap]
The Ergo 4000 has  <i> keys that don't feel nearly as good <i>  as those from older keyboards - this being my major reason why I won't buy this keyboard (I would have otherwise). [has, do, feel, being, buy, have] [good, older, major]
I like keys that have a consistent feedback. [like, have] [consistent]
They feel like cheap plastic (some  <i> keys are harder to hit  <i> and some are so light after a while that they get activated as soon as they are gently touched). [feel, are, hit, are, get, activated, are, touched] [cheap, harder, light]
A keyboard has its first use: be good and efficient in hitting those keys - all the other stuff is secondary! [has, be, hitting, is] [first, good, efficient, other, secondary]
The first thing I tried it, I immediately realized that I  <i> need a very hard press on keys <i> . [tried, realized, need] [first, hard]
Partly because I was trained on IBM selectrics and manual typewriters that belonged to my grandparents, and partly because I'm a classically trained cellist, my fingers slam into those keys fast and hard. [was, trained, belonged, 'm, trained, slam] [manual]
Since the ergonomic keyboards are shaped in a wave form (of sorts) there is a nominal communication from the keys that one has indeed typed that letter. [are, shaped, is, has, typed] [ergonomic, nominal]
Number one annoyance:  The Caps Lock key is placed so closely to the Tab and Shift keys that I am forever grumbling at this machine as I accidentally hit the Caps Lock key instead of Shift or Tab. [is, placed, keys, am, grumbling, hit] [key]
When you first get this keyboard (especially new builds, 2011) their keys are soft and quiet and it's the best keyboard there is. [get, builds, are, 's, is] [new, soft, quiet, best]
After about 2 weeks to 1 month, the  <i> keys start becoming louder <i> , less smooth, while still functional. [start, becoming] [less, smooth, functional]
I find that the  <i> keys feel, well, soft to me <i> , for lack of a better word. [find, feel] [soft, better]
The <i>  keys lack a responsive crispness <i>  that better keyboards have. [lack, have] [responsive, better]
Some terrible things about the product (when compared to the Chinese iPazzPort, which is likely a knockoff of the Rii that has other features added): * The mouse is not multi-touch * There are no page-up/page-down keys that can be accessed without also holding down the "function" key (compared to the iPazzPort which has a page up/down rocker on the side of the device next to the laser pointer switch) * The laser pointer is very weak compared to the iPazzPort * The laser pointer requires the radio to be turned on * The F-keys are the default; you have to use the function+Fkey combination to access things like volume up/down. [compared, is, has, added, is, are, be, accessed, holding, compared, has, is, compared, requires, be, turned, are, have, use] [terrible, Chinese, likely, other, multi-touch, page-up\, up\, weak]
Because the F keys can be activated without a key combination, they can be combined with modifiers (like ALT) which makes application hot keys (e. [be, activated, be, combined, makes] [key, hot]
Finally, there are nubs on the F and J keys to allow for finding the home row in the dark (although the blue backlighting (compare to orange with the iPazzPort) is easy to activate). [are, allow, finding, compare, is, activate] [dark, blue, easy]
I was also happy to find that Windows multimedia keys were included on the keyboard. [was, find, were, included] [happy]
I am an average-sized woman at 5'5", and have relatively long fingers, but the reach on this keyboard from the home keys to the Q/Tab or backspace/enter was absurdly and uncomfortably far. [am, have, was] [average-sized, long]
And I found that the  <i> angle of the keys  <i> meant my elbows had to be kept at an uncomfortably wide angle, causing instant discomfort in my shoulder muscles. [found, meant, had, be, kept, causing] [uncomfortably, wide, instant]
The 'H' key didn't work and two other  <i> keys were very sticky <i> , making a really annoying loud clicking sound each time I hit them. [did, work, were, making, hit] [key, other, sticky, annoying, loud]
Although all of the keys worked on the second keyboard, they still felt really stiff (especially the space bar), making for a very unpleasant typing experience. [worked, felt, making, typing] [second, stiff, unpleasant]
Extra F keys (Fn+1=F9, Fn+2=F10, Fn+3=F11, and Fn+4=F12) 3) Sometimes capslock get reversed I'm not sure why it happens but to go back to normal with caps on switch keyboard off the back on. [get, reversed, 'm, happens, go] [Extra, capslock, sure, normal]
All the other keys were soft and easy to type. [were] [other, soft, easy]
The  <i> keys are soft <i> . [are] [soft]
It just doesn't have the extra keys like calculator, volume control, etc. [does, have] [extra]
Elite also has smaller keys for the arrow keys, the page up/down, home/end, and delete/insert keys. [has] [smaller, delete\]
Much as I like the subtly curved design and the widening keys, the power shortcut keys, they're of no use to me when it repetedly breaks down. [like, widening, 're, breaks] [subtly, curved]
The mechanisms don't seem to be built for larger keys, so you have to find sweet spots in keys like CTRL and the space bar, or else you're just bending plastic without registering a keystroke. [do, seem, be, built, have, find, 're, bending, registering] [larger, sweet]
On OS X, IntelliType is required if you want to swap the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys to represent CTRL, Option, and Command keys on a standard Mac keyboard. [is, required, want, swap, represent] [standard]
This keyboard only lasted 4 months and then random  <i> keys stopped working <i> . [lasted, stopped, working] [random]
other than that, just hate that microsoft messed up on the keycodes for the zoom keys. [hate, messed] [other]
The simultaneous pressing of 3 or 4  <i> keys causes some sort of lock-up <i>  and your keyboard will send a constant signal of movement, even though you've lifted your hands off the keyboard. [pressing, causes, send, 've, lifted] [simultaneous, lock-up, constant]
It will lock-up and have my character running in some random direction no matter which keys I hit after that. [lock-up, have, running, keys, hit] [random]
(Mine showed up with three  <i> keys dislodged <i> , and didn't function after careful set up--no number lock/caps lock lights to suggest it was responding to either of my up-to-date computers. [showed, dislodged, did, set, lock\, suggest, was, responding] [careful, lock, up-to-date]
After only a few days of use, the spacebar stopped working, and the number  <i> keys were either broken <i>  or typing strange combinations. [stopped, working, were, broken, typing] [few, strange]
The action of the  <i> keys are stiff <i> , and what is worse: noisy. [are, is] [stiff, worse]
Extra keys above number pad are useful and make sense. [are, make] [Extra, useful]
HOME END BLOCK and Arrow keys maintain their usual shape which is good. [maintain, is] [usual, good]
'Back' and 'Forward' keys not real keyboard keys and they stick. [keys, stick] [real]
The  <i> keys could be slightly smaller <i> . [be] [smaller]
The 'back' and 'forward' should be replace with real keys that can be programmed to something useful to the user like backspace, enter, cntl, cmd or windows key. [be, replace, be, programmed, enter, cntl, cmd] [real, useful]
With this keyboard you can program those keys like that now but the fact that they stick and are not real  <i> keys make that useless <i> . [program, stick, are, make] [real, useless]
This would hopefully reduce the need to constantly use ones little fingers to hit these important keys with out freaking of users that want to maintain as much normalcy as possible. [reduce, use, hit, want, maintain] [little, important, out, much, possible]
I like the special keys for Zoom, Back, Forward, Calculator, - () backspace. [like] [special]
It seems obvious that a lot of people are having certain  <i> keys conk out  <i> at some point. [seems, are, having, conk] [obvious, certain]
When typing the main keys you are fine and this definitely has a much more ergonomic feel than other keyboards I have tested over the years. [typing, are, has, have, tested] [main, fine, more, ergonomic, other]
The problem lies when you have to  <i> reach for the keys <i>  (that are hard to reach even on a regular keyboard) such as the 1,2,0,-,+,and BACKSPACE keys. [lies, have, reach, are, reach] [hard, regular, such]
If you have above average length fingers this may not be a problem but if you have average to below-average length fingers/hands there is definitely a problem due to the fact that these  <i> keys slope downward  <i> away from the reach of your hands in addition to the regular reach you have on a non-ergonomic keyboard. [have, be, have, is, have] [above, average, average, below-average, due, regular, non-ergonomic]
Those  <i> keys are in a different zip-code  <i> on this keyboard. [are] [different]
The downward slope feels great with the regular keys but constant reaching for the 1,2,0,-,+, and BACKSPACE  <i> keys will cause pain <i>  rapidly. [feels, reaching, cause] [downward, great, regular, constant]
If they would have made those keys closer or not had those  <i> keys slope down  <i> and away from your hands it might be OK. [have, made, had, be] [OK]
Or if they made the keys near them smaller to  <i> make these keys a little closer <i> . [made, make] [smaller]
Or if they made one with  <i> smaller keys <i> , or keys not so far apart, or out of reach due to the downward slope of the keyboard. [made] [smaller, due, downward]
As for the non-ergonomic aspect of the keyboard there are plenty of keys along the top of the keyboard that can be programmed to limit the amount of times one has to use a mouse. [are, be, programmed, limit, has, use] [non-ergonomic]
I hope this review helps and gives incentive to the majority of us without large hands/fingers to test it in a computer store/electronics store first to see how well your fingers can reach some of those out of  <i> out-of reach keys <i> . [hope, helps, gives, test, store, see, reach] [large, out-of]
The keys have a good feel. [have] [good]
Also,  the space bar requires much more push than the rest of the keys. [requires] [more]
Pros: - nice compact size for thumb typing on the couch - good battery life and recharge-ability via USB - up/down left/right keys nice for navigating WMC and XBMC - back-lit keys for dark rooms Cons: - not durable at all (don't let it fall) - laser pointer feature useless for my application of this product (might be okay for PowerPoint slide viewing on a projector screen) - very limited RF receiver to keyboard range - has to have very unobstructed line of sight or typing/mousing functionality will be severely impacted - very bad placement of left/right mouse click buttons (after using this product I can say the ideal place for these would be in the upper left-hand corner ; thank you for this lesson FAVI as I will keep it in mind while I'm searching for your product's replacement) This was my first attempt at the ultimate HTPC keyboard/mouse, and after using it, I can say this product was good at pointing out all the flaws of these types of devices in today's market. [typing, navigating, do, let, fall, be, viewing, has, have, typing\, be, impacted, using, say, be, thank, keep, 'm, searching, was, using, say, was, pointing] [nice, compact, good, up\, left\, nice, back-lit, dark, durable, useless, okay, limited, unobstructed, bad, left\, ideal, upper, left-hand, first, ultimate, good]
It is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used because of the curved layout and the super soft keys. [is, 've, used] [comfortable, curved, super, soft]
Unfortunately, after a few months using the keyboard, some of the  <i> keys stopped working  <i> properly. [using, stopped, working] [few]
Other reviewers have had similar  <i> problems with other keys <i> . [have, had] [Other, similar, other]
All the extra  <i> keys just sit there <i> , I haven't trained myself to use them. [sit, have, trained, use] [extra]
I ultimately chose it for ergonomics, and it's insert/home/delete/end configuration, which was very important to me, because I use those keys constantly too. [chose, 's, was, use] [insert\, important]
The first is that sometimes it will lose signal for 5-10 second, after which time all the keystrokes you make may or may not appear at once. [is, lose, make, appear] [first, 5-10, second]
The second is that the volume  <i> keys don't work  <i> unless you have clicked on the volume icon in the taskbar first, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the keys in the first place. [is, do, work, have, clicked, defeats, having] [second, first]
It is a little difficult to use due to it's non standard layout, the  <i> keys feel a little mushy  <i> and the overall construction is a little flimsy. [is, use, 's, feel, is] [little, difficult, due, non, standard, little, mushy, overall, little, flimsy]
really, i found most of the hot keys MS decided to put on the keyboard not very usefull: mail, search, home, calculator and then 5 custom keys. [found, MS, decided, put] [most, hot, usefull]
it has media keys that do work with the mac; but it's missing a very important "next track" and somewhat less important "prev track". [has, do, work, 's, missing] [important, next, important]
the keys on the apple keyboard are very nice: short action, soft touch, tactile feedback. [are] [nice, short, soft, tactile]
of course, the predefined hotkeys on the apple keyboard suit my mac better: expose, dashboard, and a full set of itunes controls. [predefined, expose] [full]
It's a great, lightweight, quiet design and has just the right amount of "extra" keys. ['s, has] [great, lightweight, quiet, right, extra]
I also found it  <i> hard to see the keys  <i> in a dimly lit room even with the back light on. [found, see, lit] [hard, back]
This is the only keyboard I have ever had where  <i> keys routinely cease to respond <i> . [is, have, had, cease, respond] [only]
So maybe I guess I just bought a faulty one; surely Microsoft does not make and entire model of keyboard where the keys malfunction after only a few months. [guess, bought, does, make] [faulty, entire, few]
I bought this keyboard once, experienced the  <i> malfunctioning keys  <i> and decided to bright the "faulty" keyboard home to use with my laptop and buy a new one for work. [bought, experienced, malfunctioning, decided, use, buy] [bright, faulty, new]
I had owned one of these keyboards a few years ago and the  <i> keys started going bad <i> . [had, owned, started, going] [few, bad]
Most of the time keystrokes get throught with no problem, but for no obvious reason, the keyboard occasionally locks up and  <i> keystrokes aren't registered <i> . [keystrokes, get, locks, are, registered] [Most, throught, obvious]
All keys (including left and right click under the touchpad), backlight, and laser pointer still work. [including, left] [right]
Got the perfect touchpad sensitivity in the first shipment, but there was  <i> something wrong with one of the keys <i> . [Got, was] [perfect, first, wrong]
The board & mouse have a great feel and are very responsive, until the  <i> keys stop working <i> . [have, are, stop, working] [great, responsive]
At first my  <i> keys stop registering <i>  and I would have to push really hard on them to input, I thought a change of batteries would fix the problem. [stop, registering, have, push, thought, fix] [first, hard]
Eventually, most of the  <i> keys completely stopped working <i>  right after the warrenty ran out,of course. [stopped, working, ran] [most]
So next I opted for this, the even cheaper 2000 keyboard only, as the mouse that came with the 3000 still works great, and sure enough, the  <i> keys started to become unresponsive  <i> after a few months! [opted, came, works, started, become] [next, cheaper, great, unresponsive, few]
I've had one Comfort Curve 4000 and two 2000s and all of them have failed --- some of the  <i> keys become unresponsive <i> . ['ve, had, have, failed, become] [unresponsive]
I have Dell keyboards that after 10 years the labels on the keys are just fine. [have, are] [fine]
The keys have a nice tactile feel; nothing outstanding, but it feels better than many keyboards I have used. [have, feels, have, used] [nice, tactile, outstanding, better, many]
However, it uses a non-standard layout for the home, end, and delete  <i> keys which can be difficult  <i> to get used to. [uses, delete, be, get, used] [non-standard, difficult]
Even then, even if you mashed some keys on your keyboard at the same time you woke up your mouse, they keyboard will take longer. [mashed, woke, take] [same]
The arrow-directional  <i> keys are not in the standard position <i> , or like they are on other Microsoft natural Keyboards, which is odd. [are, are, is] [arrow-directional, standard, other, natural, odd]
But even though they keyboard was not being used that often, the same issue reoccurred a few months later and two other  <i> keys would no longer type <i> . [was, being, used, reoccurred] [same, few, other]
The other  <i> keys are also a bit too stiff <i> . [are] [other, stiff]
The spacebar works and the keys are softer but by no means too soft. [works, are] [softer, soft]
A lot of people have commented on the function keys but the exact working of these convenience  <i> keys is a minor issue <i>  for me. [have, commented, is] [exact, minor]
Thing is, it's a windows keyboard so even though it uses a USB, none of the internet keys work with the imac, with the exception of the volume control, and that's disappointing. [is, 's, uses, keys, 's] [disappointing]
Anyway, this product does what I bought it to do, but looking at those  <i> dead shortcut keys  <i> all the time bums me out. [does, bought, do, looking, keys] [dead]
Other  <i> keys also got sticky  <i> after a few weeks of use. [got] [Other, sticky, few]
The keys are in decent places. [are] [decent]
The spacebar has  <i> more resistance than the other keys  <i> and that is not pleasant. [has, is] [more, other, pleasant]
For one, people say the keys are quite easy to press, it is, slightly. [say, are, press, is] [easy]
The keys are quiet but the  <i> depression of the keys are a little bit harder  <i> than the previous models. [are, are] [quiet, little, harder, previous]
The thing I hate the most is when you're typing and the  <i> keys are hard to press <i>  or you have to hit the keys at a certain angle in order for it to go down and register. [hate, is, 're, typing, are, press, have, hit, go, register] [hard, certain]
This 4000 model, the keys are soft yet you have to hit the  <i> keys a little bit harder <i>  for it to go down. [are, have, hit, go] [soft, little]
The wireless optical pro kit that has a ergo keybord like this is much softer meaning all you have to do is slightly tap the keys and you're good to go. [has, is, have, do, is, tap, 're, go] [wireless, optical, pro, much, softer, good]
I just cannot stand typing on keyboards that have  <i> keys that are hard to press <i> . [stand, typing, have, are] [hard]
The design is nice but the  <i> keys are hard to press  <i> which mean you have to hit the keys that much more harder. [is, are, press, mean, have, hit] [nice, hard, more]
It's compact, has a full keyboard with a logical layout of keys, has an effective touchpad with a scrolling zone on the right side, and has great backlighting and battery life. ['s, has, has, has] [compact, full, logical, effective, right, great]
On rare occasions this happens with other keys as well. [happens] [rare, other]
I had to replace the first one because I spilled something on it and after that it would type  <i> incorrect letters for the keys struck <i> . [had, replace, spilled, struck] [first, incorrect]
I bought this to replace my original generation natural keyboard which I had for seven years at work before one of the  <i> keys stopped functioning <i> . [bought, replace, had, stopped, functioning] [original, natural]
If you set the keyboard down flat, most keyboards the keys will sit pretty close to flat from the row with the numbers on it to the row with the space bar on it. [set, sit] [flat, most, flat]
The key layout in the positioning of the keys is good and the feel of the keys is nice, and I do like the ergonomically design to keyboards, but for the combination of the  <i> keys being lower in the center <i>  and the flat design, we will be looking to get a different one. [is, is, do, being, be, looking, get] [key, good, nice, lower, flat, different]
I just use it to do my work and paper typing, but the unacceptable thing is that several keys' "life expectancy" is too short. [use, do, is, is] [unacceptable, several, short]
It's a nice enough keyboard and mouse, but it has a terrible time with  <i> dropped keystrokes <i>  and multi-second keystroke lag. ['s, has, dropped] [nice, enough, terrible, multi-second]
It's completely unusable in games: Nothing brings you out of gaming annoys you quite like your keyboard simply stopping working for 5-10 seconds at a time, and THEN sending all those keystrokes at once. ['s, brings, like, stopping, working, sending] [unusable, 5-10]
The  <i> keystrokes start lagging <i>  and the cursor action is very choppy around only 5' away. [start, lagging, is] [choppy]
I am using this keyboard on the mac - i was able to program the keys all ok - took some doing. [am, using, was, program, took, doing] [able]
Overall it works well but some of the  <i> keys have a very loose, cheap feeling <i> . [works, have] [Overall, loose, cheap]
Even when connected the connection was spotty from any more than 5 feet away and  <i> keystrokes were not recognized  <i> most of the time. [connected, was, were, recognized] [spotty, more, most]
but this is not the key board for you if you are used to  <i> finding keys by instinct <i> . [is, are, used, finding] [key]
some  <i> keys are not where they ought to be <i>  (or at least not where people are generally used to finding them intuitively--shift key for example), located in wrong places and in wrong (meaning, disproportionate) sizes and shapes. [are, be, are, used, finding, located] [least, wrong, wrong, disproportionate]
The touch of the keys is soft and comfy, the ergonomic design is brilliant and requires little adjustment, but the space bar  sticks and clacks. [is, is, requires] [soft, comfy, ergonomic, brilliant, little]
a)  <i> keys get stuck <i>  b) range is at most 2 feet, not *up to 100* feet as advertized on the box. [get, stuck, is, advertized] [most]
Limited range and  <i> stuck keys  <i> makes it useless for HTPC. [stuck, makes] [Limited, useless]
 <i> Same keys failed <i> , in about a month. [failed] [Same]
It is difficult to pick the device up without  <i> pressing keys <i> . [is, pick, pressing] [difficult]
The keys are easy to use. [are, use] [easy]
 <i> Some keys are sensitive <i>  while others need breaking into. [are, need, breaking] [sensitive]
The  <i> keys are grid shaped <i> , not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys. [are, shaped, offset, 's, say, has, reach, hit] [normal, easy, further]
So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys. ['re, thinking, be, consider] [dead]
Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it  <i> drops keystrokes <i>  about every 5th input. [Sitting, found, drops] [5th]
Also, these  <i> keys are now half-sized <i> , and therefore harder to hit. [are, hit] [half-sized, harder]
These may seem like minor quibbles to some of you -- but they preclude the possibility of hitting these keys without looking at them. [seem, preclude, hitting, looking] [minor]
This does not have a full sized keyboard, and while I thought I might be able to live with it anyway, my hands are too large and I'm too used to a full sized keyboard to get my fingers to hit the correct keys, even when concentrating. [does, have, sized, thought, be, live, are, 'm, used, sized, get, hit, concentrating] [full, able, large, full, correct]
The right shift key, in particular, is a real problem because Logitech replaces the full sized key with two smaller keys: Shift and Enter. [is, replaces, sized, Enter] [right, particular, real, full, smaller]
Pros: Installs easily, Small size, good battery life, keys work well. [keys] [Small, good]
The slight curve design has alleviated a great deal of pain on my wrists and the shortcut keys are great for fast access to the email, web, etc. [has, alleviated, are] [slight, great, great, fast]
All the  <i> keys are designed very cheaply  <i> and will not take a great deal of repeated use, especially if you are heavy handed. [are, designed, take, repeated, are, handed] [great, heavy]
Comparing with my previous one, which is also logitech, the  <i> keys in this keyboard are a bit small <i>  and harder to hit. [Comparing, is, are, hit] [previous, logitech, small, harder]
The curve and the size of some of the keys, however, make it not optimal for the small-handed, such as myself. [make] [optimal, small-handed, such]
Alt-f4 doesn't work because Microsoft remapped the keys on this keyboard so the keyboard's shortcuts don't work the same way as the Windows operating system. [does, work, remapped, do, work] [same]
On almost every occasion I would have to hit one of my password characters twice and at same time double check the screen so I didn't miss type or type extra keys. [have, hit, did, miss] [same, double, extra]
Still, it was VERY difficult to reach the upper keys, even after I got used to the split keyboard. [was, reach, got, used] [difficult, upper]
I use some of the extra keys, for example, I use the sound volume and muting functions frequently, as well as the calculator button. [use, use, muting] [extra, sound]
Because I use a 4-key trackball, I have no use for the browsing keys. [use, have, browsing] [4-key]
I already discarded one and replaced it due to  <i> failing keys <i> . [discarded, replaced, failing] [due]
I've had about 3 so far, and some have had  <i> failed keys  <i> (the ALT key sometimes is difficult to press). ['ve, had, have, had, failed, is] [difficult]
I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller  <i> squished-together arrow keys <i> . [agree, regarding, changed] [other, negative, smaller, smaller]
Typing can be quite a chore, you will be typing along and then certain <i>  keys just don't respond <i> , not always the same key and quite sporadic to which one(s) it chooses. [Typing, be, be, typing, do, respond, chooses] [certain, same, sporadic]
The keyboard is so light/flimsy and the  <i> keys are clunky feeling <i> . [is, are] [light\, clunky]
Also, there is no way of having indication of when caps/scroll lock/numlock keys are on/off, which is stupid because my very old S510 told me on-screen through the SetPoint software- which **should** work with this combo also, but it doesn't. [is, having, are, is, told, does] [caps\, on\, stupid, old, on-screen]
So if you get this then forget having any extra adjustments or on-screen displays for volume, lock keys, etc. [get, forget, having] [extra, on-screen, lock]
I will say neither the kbd or mouse ever missed a keystroke or click, but most any keyboard can do that. [say, missed, do] [most]
This keyboard is horrible for people with repetitive stress injuries because the  <i> keys are so hard to depress <i> . [is, are, depress] [horrible, repetitive, hard]
I'm not sure what the manufacturer was thinking (maybe harder to push  <i> keys give the illusion of sturdiness <i> ) but it is irritating for wrists that are already prone to inflammation. ['m, was, thinking, push, give, is, irritating, are] [sure, harder, prone]
I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller  <i> squished-together arrow keys <i> . [agree, regarding, changed] [other, negative, smaller, smaller]
I was glad for the function keys, since this is replacing one of those wired Dell multimedia keyboards with the round volume control knobs (which I really liked). [was, is, replacing, wired, liked] [glad]
The  <i> keys themselves are hard plastic <i>  but they feel mushy when pressed. [are, feel, pressed] [hard, mushy]
The  <i> keys are glossy and hard <i> , compared to what is shown here. [are, compared, is, shown] [glossy, hard]
Regardless, the  <i> keys are very difficult to type  <i> on compared to the T-Mobile G2 keyboard that I'm used using on a daily basis. [are, compared, 'm, used, using] [difficult, T-Mobile, daily]
It also take a while to  <i> get use to the smaller keys <i>  like the shift and the backspace. [take, get, use] [smaller]
The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for. [have, are, was, looking] [great, tactile, quiet]
Any time I would press certain keys (E, C, X, Enter, Delete), the thing would go haywire and press all kinds of random characters and cause general chaos in both my Windows XP and Mac OS X machines. [press, Enter, Delete, go] [certain, random, general]
It always happened when I would press a key (such as the arrow keys) in rapid succession. [happened, press] [such, rapid]

I'm largely happy with this keyboard but will note several caveats: * The media keys do not provide next/previous track keys * The elevating skirt to raise the front edge of the keyboard is awkward to add/remove and is cheaply constructed * The keys are quite responsive but are a bit louder than I think they need to be, particularly the spacebar Ergonomically this is the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used. ['m, note, do, provide, elevating, raise, is, add\, is, constructed, are, are, think, need, be, is, 've, used] [happy, several, next\, front, awkward, responsive, comfortable]

I have been using older microsoft ergo keyboards for years without issues, but these ones seem to have a few issues the buyer should be aware of: *The lettering on the  <i> keys WILL wear off <i>  and do so FAST. [have, been, using, seem, have, be, lettering, wear, do] [older, few, aware]
*The larger  <i> keys tend to lose their ability <i>  to stay properly centered. [tend, lose, stay, centered] [larger]

The status lights don't work - The drag and drop won't work - the auto shutoff for the backlighting does not work - the range is 3 feet up to 9 if I place the dongle and hold the keyboard just right - the backlighting is uneven behind the keys -  <i> not all keys make good contact <i>  - and those are just preliminary observations - the inept lack of ergonomics makes it seem like it was built by a committee of hair-brained wannabe sub-nerds - I took the chance and lost.

My previous keyboard had a solid feel and the keys were very responsive. [had, were] [previous, solid, responsive]
The spacebar is half-responsive, and the tiny little function, arrow and page  <i> keys are a nightmare <i> . [is, are] [half-responsive, tiny, little]
Unfortunately, both in the past few weeks have started to  <i> "lose" keys  <i> or require that they be pressed for an inordinate amount of time to actually communicate with the controller in the keyboard to recognize :-/.

I was deceived by its stylish look, and when I started using it, immediately I found that the cursor keys and the page up/down, home/end  <i> keys are so awkwardly placed <i> , making the keyboard virtually useless in OS where you absolutely need those keys -- like Windows. [was, deceived, started, using, found, are, placed, making, need] [stylish, useless]

The arrangement of the Home/Page Up/Page Dn/End/Delete/Insert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays, but otherwise it is insane. [allow, fit, is] [insane]

The arrows  <i> keys are nearly impossible to use <i> , especially for gaming. [are, use] [impossible]

I can live with cheap feel of the keyboard but not  <i> different spacing for keys <i> . [live, spacing] [cheap, different]
The keys seem to work ok from that distance, but the trackpad is very laggy at about 5M - 6M away. [seem, work, is] [laggy]

) and resetting all the programmable keys to defaults, not like that would probably solve the problem, and of course the errors still occur. [resetting, solve, occur] [programmable]
The  <i> keys were very stiff <i> . [were] [stiff]
I spend a great deal of time using a keyboard, and I have to have one that is responsive all the time, not one that requires me to  <i> beat on the keys  <i> to get them to work properly. [spend, using, have, have, is, requires, beat, get, work] [great, responsive]

The  <i> keystroke doesn't register <i>  if I don't hit at exactly the right angle on about 5 or 6 keys, and for these tired hands, after 8 or 10 hours at the glo box, I don't find the touch soft enough, even though I've read it described as soft.

I felt like I had to  <i> reach excessively for some keys <i> , like "y," "control," and "enter". [felt, had, reach, enter] [y]
Pluses:  Best feeling wrist rest, ergonomically designed reverse angle, the zoom rocker and back/forward keys. [designed] [Best]
Design-wise it is on the right track, the wrists are less pronated because of the angle of the keys. [is, are, pronated] [right]

I'm constantly typing gibberish because my fingers are on the wrong keys. ['m, typing, are] [wrong]

[works, shoot, connect, using, plug] [rechargable, small, portable, useless, other, cheap, limited, best, mine, wont]
I attributed this to the unusual wave design of the key layout which is supposed to promote stress free typing, which is does -- but while promoting a bad style of typing preventing the keyboard user from typing all other keys!

The keys on this keyboard don't "snap back" like some of the better keyboards do when you press them down. [do, snap, do, press] [better]
While the keyboard 100% works (and the extra functions do also), I really dislike that pushing down on the  <i> keys doesn't give you the response <i>  that some of the other better MS keyboards do also. [do, dislike, pushing, does, give, do] [extra, other, better]
In general this is a good keyboard: * comfortable wrist pads * excellent ergonomic positioning of the keys * plug and play in windows 7 - I did not install the software that came with keyboard and all the keys I ever use work without it (including volume up/down, play/pause etc. [is, did, install, came, use, including] [general, good, comfortable, excellent, ergonomic]

I'd use a newer model of it, but they also ruined the layout when they added the shift feature to the function keys. [use, ruined, added] [newer]
Would have been fine if the default was for the function keys, but no, they made it for the others, which have always been shortcuts on your keyboard anyway. [have, been, was, made, have, been] [fine]
When typing, sometimes the  <i> keys stick <i>  and enter two or three times, other times they fail to respond at all. [typing, stick, enter, fail, respond] [other]
If there are typos in this message, it is ecause some of the  <i> keys on this very keyoard are dead <i>  now. [are, is, ecause, are] [dead]
I'm a two fingered typist na the ergo design is too big and the hump in the middle  <i> spreads the keys out too much <i>  and slows my type of typing down,  pluss the hump in the middle causes you to need light on two sides of the keyboard light on only one side causes shadows on the opposite side, if your a visual typist like me you  <i> lose sight of half the keys  <i> in a dimly lit room. ['m, fingered, is, slows, typing, pluss, need, causes, lose, lit] [big, middle, much, middle, opposite, visual]
If your a touch typist and use all your fingers and don't look at the keys it's fine once you get used to the hump in the middle of the key board, but I can type faster with two or three fingers than I can with nine. [use, do, look, 's, get, used] [fine, key]
Keyboard has a nice feel to it, nice feedback from the keys. [has] [nice, nice]
Certain  <i> keys quit working <i> and had to break out the old keyboard. [quit, working, had, break] [Certain, old]
Undaunted, I tried another, the second board was slightly better in that all the keys seemed to work. [tried, was, seemed, work] [Undaunted, second]
The keys - especially the space bar - require far more force to use that my previous keyboard. [require, use] [previous]
The arrow  <i> keys are way too small <i>  and have non-standard placement. [are, have] [small, non-standard]
The function keys and the home, end, pageup, pagedown  <i> keys are also much smaller <i> . [are] [smaller]
I find it extremely  <i> difficult to use these keys <i> . [find, use] [difficult]
Of course, the split keys are OK. [are] [OK]
Unfortunately it isn't very bright and many of the  <i> keys aren't really lit up <i>  at all. [is, are, lit] [bright, many]
Depressing all other  <i> keys takes more pressure <i>  than I'm accustomed to using. [Depressing, takes, 'm, using] [other, accustomed]
The distance between keys and the size of some  <i> keys is different <i>  than the Elite. [is] [different]
The  <i> keys are too difficult to press <i>  and the space bar is essentially unusable. [are, press, is] [difficult, unusable]
The curve of the  <i> keys is extremely minor <i> , so much so that it feels (on the wrists and hands) almost exactly like a standard keyboard. [is, feels] [minor, standard]
It is also quite low profile which would be alright except that there is only about an inch of plastic to try to rest your hands on below the bottom row of keys, which means that your hands are sitting on the desk as you try to type. [is, be, is, try, rest, means, are, sitting, try] [low, alright, bottom]
The arrow keys are much more difficult to use than the standard, well-designed inverted T layout. [are, use] [difficult, well-designed, inverted]
While your fingers rested comfortably on the bottom row of arrow keys in the old layout, in the new your fingers don't really fit at all--you can only put two fingers on at once, and you need to move them in awkward ways to switch to the up and down keys from the left and right keys. [rested, do, fit, put, need, move, switch] [bottom, old, new, awkward, right]
Why move the keys around into a LESS useful layout? [move] [useful]
If you're like me and you end up typing on lots of different keyboards, AND you use the arrow keys a lot to navigate, it turns out to be quite painful to switch back and forth between the different layouts. ['re, end, typing, use, keys, navigate, turns, be, switch] [different, painful, different]
- The <i> printing etc on the keys is also VERY bad <i> . [is] [bad]
unfortunately, i'm going to return it to the store primarily because the  <i> keys are just too hard  <i> to push -- especially the spacebar. ['m, going, return, are, push] [hard]
( very smoth transaction no hassle) I am pleased with the performance but the  <i> keys are a bit sticky <i>  and the mouse is very touchy, but i understand that the keyboard will loosen up over time. [am, are, is, understand, loosen] [smoth, pleased, sticky, touchy]
Media control keys should be switched with Function Keys, I'm sure people will be using the play/pause button more often than F7. [be, switched, 'm, be, using] [sure]
Range is good, about what is advertized, but I have found that if there is something/someone between keyboard and receiver than its about 50% on keystroke accuracy. [is, is, advertized, have, found, is, something\] [good]
With a clear line of sight I would but keystroke accuracy at about 90% Final Thoughts: I am very happy with the price/product. [am] [clear, Final, happy]
The right shift key seemed to have been made poorly b/c it was much louder and had a different pitch than the other keys. [seemed, have, been, made, b\, was, had] [right, much, different, other]
I started using it and two  <i> keys went dead  <i> after less than 6 months of light use. [started, using, went] [dead, less, light]
I have owned this keyboard for 4 days now, I loved it at first, lightweight comfortable to use, the keys aren't loud when you're typing and then tonight I began having problems. [have, owned, loved, use, are, 're, typing, began, having] [lightweight, comfortable]
Everything about it is good in principle:  the keys are big enough to easily press, light up nicely in the dark, and are still small enough to fit in something the size of a normal remote. [is, are, press, light, are, fit] [good, big, dark, small, normal, remote]
The main thing I've been looking for in a new ergonomic keyboard is the correct setup for the arrow keys, with left, down, and right in a straight row, and up right above down (follow that? ['ve, been, looking, is, left, follow] [main, new, ergonomic, correct, straight]
All the keys have a fairly consistent feel and are quiet. [have, are] [consistent, quiet]
I preferred the utility button layout of the older Natural Keyboard Pro, and rather wish the function keys had their normal functions on the top (F1, F2, etc. [preferred, wish, had] [older, Natural, normal]
If all the keys were this loud, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's very annoying and distracting to be typing and have a very loud slam/click every time I hit a space. [were, be, 's, distracting, be, typing, have, hit] [loud, annoying, loud]
I have a pretty hard keystroke, so I really put it through the wringer. [have, put] [hard]
A few  <i> keys were loose  <i> in the box when I got it, and I had to reconnect them manually. [were, got, had, reconnect] [few, loose]
The  <i> keys were tight <i> , with no play. [were] [tight]
It has decent keys, etc. [has] [decent]
Even after it dried out, most of the  <i> keys either didn't work <i> , or generated seemingly random keypresses. [dried, did, work, generated] [most, random]
Some of the  <i> keys stopped working <i>  because it was humid. [stopped, working, was] [humid]
I ordered this keyboard for it's small size and backlit keys. [ordered, 's] [small, backlit]
The keyboard has a bad problem with missing keystrokes and with  <i> stuck keys <i> . [has, missing] [bad, stuck]
Several  <i> keys are difficult to type <i> , such as! [are] [Several, difficult, such]
This was the second keyboard and some of the  <i> keys did not work <i> . [was, did] [second]
It's comfortable in the hand, the keys give a nice tactile feedback when pressing them, the touchpad works great, the backlight works great. ['s, give, pressing, works, works] [comfortable, nice, great, great]
- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the keys are physically separated into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal. [Compared, has, note, are, separated, be] [other, Ergonomic, ergonomic, minimal]
- As an avid gamer favoring the right side of the keyboard (arrow keys instead of the WASD configuration) I enjoyed the ample room around the former. [favoring, enjoyed] [avid, right, ample, former]
- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers) Now, THE BAD: - For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT  <i> keys are too small <i> ! [liked, hated, finding, closing, are] [extra, top, small]
I could do with regular sized "H" and "N" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER. [do, sized, keys, mean] [regular]
- The Media keys on top do not sit well in their homings and are not perfectly aligned. [do, sit, are, aligned] [top]
I also must have missed the part about the center of the keyboard being raised and the shape and placement of the  <i> keys really bothered my right hand/wrist <i>  - so I am sending it back. [have, missed, being, raised, bothered, am, sending] [right]
It did seem to have some neat features/ short cut keys though - I am really disappointed the rest of it didn't work better. [did, seem, have, \, am, disappointed, did, work] [neat, short]
The wider base and outward angle of the keys put me in a more natural typing posture with less strain on my wrists. [put] [wider, outward, more, natural, less]
Not only does this keyboard put me in a better position with the keys angled out, it also raises the front end of the keyboard, further forcing the user into good typing posture. [does, put, angled, raises, forcing] [better, front, further, good]
Unfortunately I do have issues with the keys in the bottom row of the right group (n, m, comma, period, /) not registering. [do, have, registering] [bottom, right]
However, the one I just received in black had a very loud space bar that was also too loose, especially compared to all of the other keys. [received, had, was, compared] [black, loud, loose, other]
This is a great keyboard, but the painted on letters on the  <i> keys are not durable <i>  and will soon rub off. [is, painted, are, rub] [great, durable]
Suggest you paint all your keys with clear fingernail polish to protect the painted on letters. [paint, protect, painted] [Suggest, clear]
Generally, it is the way the keyboard is grounded internally, which causes certain  <i> keys to not function <i>  after time. [is, is, grounded, causes, function] [certain]
It could be any number of keys or any pattern of keys that will go faulty because of poor grounding internally. [be, go, grounding] [faulty, poor]
My two  <i> faulty keys <i> work now, but for how long? [work] [faulty, long]
The laser pointer never worked from day one and the keyboard  <i> keys was sluggish <i>  and would then jump with multiple entries for the same key. [worked, was, jump] [sluggish, multiple, same]
After a few months of putting up with this, the keyboard started sending shutdown commands to various applications if you just lift the keyboard or touched any of the keys. [putting, started, sending, lift, touched] [few, various]
This is very frustrating to my wife who has to look at the keys to type. [is, has, look] [frustrating]
On Monday, I came to work and found that some of my keyboard's  <i> keys had become sticky <i> , as if something had been spilled on them. [came, work, found, had, become, had, been, spilled] [sticky]
Some  <i> keys are too large  <i> and others are too small, and everything about this keyboard seems to be geared towards making the product look pretty. [are, are, seems, be, geared, making] [large, small]
For someone like me, who does a lot of technical work, the fact that the control <i>  keys are mushed  <i> to be super tiny is a big problem. [does, are, mushed, be, is] [technical, super, tiny, big]
Its because of the section where the mouse pad is puts a distance between your right thumb and the alpha keys. [is, puts] [right]
The problem is that after a few months some <i>  keys started to have problems <i> , I have to hit them harder than normal to type. [is, started, have, have, hit] [few, harder, normal]
The keyboard came with dirt inside the keys, one of the back risers was broke, and two  <i> keys had the letters worn off <i> . [came, was, broke, had] [back, worn]
It has short periods of a few minutes where it works fine but then a few minutes after a movie starts, it will go back to  <i> sending random keys  <i> and functions to the PC throwing it into chaos. [has, works, starts, go, sending, throwing] [short, few, fine, few, random]
one day my cat walked on top of the keyboard and one of my <i>  keys just popped out  <i> of the socket permanently, not recommended, and going back to the elite keyboard. [walked, popped, recommended, going] [elite]
However, the  <i> keys themselves are much too firm <i> ! [are] [firm]
this morning, after a routine cleaning, the enter key, both <i>  shift keys and the question mark key stopped working <i> . [enter, stopped, working] [routine, key, key]
I use the keyboard primarily for writing, so I don't pay much attention to the other keys or their position; although, I think some of the  <i> keys are a little too small <i> . [use, writing, do, pay, think, are] [much, other, little, small]
They keys were nice & quiet which was great. [were, was] [nice, quiet, great]
I'm not used to nor need the extra special dedicated buttons/keys. ['m, used, need] [extra, special, dedicated]
By then I was so stressed, I was jealous they didn't have to deal with the curve any longer, but all my keys still worked. [was, stressed, was, did, have, deal, worked] [jealous, longer]
The keys are slightly raised so it's easy to type. [are, raised, 's] [easy]
second: WHY IS THERE A START next to my shift and ctrl keys? [IS] [second]
other than that, they keys feel okay, I miss my keytronic 1985 ergo board I had last century, it was MORE designed for ten finger typists that did 200 pages ON MECHANICAL TYPEWRITERS, a day. [keys, feel, miss, had, was, designed, did] [other, okay, keytronic, last, MORE]
sadly it appears all keybds designed after a certain year all have these misfit keys placed in the WORSE POSSIBLE PLACE. [appears, designed, have, placed] [certain, misfit]
Going to dump this and hope to find one with softer keys. [Going, dump, hope, find] [softer]
Now if Microsoft could figure out how to combine the light, pleasing keys from that with this one's ergonomic shape, they'd have a real winner. [figure, combine, pleasing, have] [ergonomic, real]
I suspect it's because instead of the older (and more expensive) method of injection molding the symbols on the keys which makes them a permanent part of the key, they are now using the much cheaper method of using something like decals which is only a surface treatment and so rub off fairly quickly. [suspect, 's, makes, are, using, using, is, rub] [older, expensive, permanent, much, cheaper]
The   <i> keys in general  are lousy <i> . [are] [general, lousy]
Second, the ergonomic design of the keyboard was quite pleasant, but the spacing and the  <i> sizing of the keys  <i> (some letter keys are larger than others) made typing a bit difficult; larger hands may find it a bit easier going. [was, sizing, are, made, typing, find, going] [ergonomic, pleasant, larger, difficult, larger, easier]
The keys were clear looking and you had to pull of a back plate of the keyboard to get to the wireless receiver. [were, looking, had, pull, get] [clear, wireless]
But i didn't notice before purchasing that the Home/End/Delete and arrows  <i> keys are smaller  <i> than normal size. [did, notice, purchasing, are] [smaller, normal]
Several keys that you will use very often are even harder: The space, backspace and enter key. [use, are, enter] [Several]
A cheaper keyboard, Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 is much better, although its "Backspace" is also stupidly harder to press than other keys. [is, is, press] [cheaper, better, harder, other]
However, be aware that Microsoft decided to rearrange several clusters of keys on this keyboard. [be, decided, rearrange] [aware, several]
The arrow keys are in a diamond pattern rather than the traditional (and IMHO efficient) "inverted-T". [are] [traditional, efficient, inverted-T]
As a touch-typist and a programmer, I've come to expect these keys to be in a certain position. ['ve, come, expect, be] [touch-typist, certain]
It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked. [have, helped, caused, hurt, having, hit, liked] [harder]
The design is great, keys are easy to push. [is, are, push] [great, easy]
on paper the promising features are: - extremly low form factor - 30 meters range - backlit - rechargable All sounds great but here's my findings after 1 week of trying to make it work: - quite ridicilous effective range - won't work correctly from within 10ft - 50% of keys type are not being transmitted, you end up typing everything twice -  <i> stuck keys <i>  - electronically not physically Overall nice try, but no cigar. [are, trying, make, work, work, are, being, transmitted, end, typing] [promising, low, backlit, rechargable, great, ridicilous, effective, stuck, Overall, nice]
There are several issues I have with this keyboard: *  <i> Keys don't have that nice soft feeling <i>  when you press them like other keyboards (including a previous Microsoft  model) have - very clunky feeling * Spacebar feels small and hard to hit for touch typing (programmer) * the arrow keys and home/end/page up/down keys are in an unusual orientation so now I have to go look and find the appropriate key where before I could naturally hit the right key without looking. [are, have, do, have, press, including, have, feels, hit, are, have, go, find, hit, looking] [several, nice, soft, other, previous, clunky, small, hard, up\, unusual, appropriate, right]
The keys feel soft and less clicky than my MS Wireless Pro keyboard ($99). [feel] [soft, clicky]
The  <i> keys are a bit stiff <i> , resulting in occasional typos due to the key-press not registering. [are, resulting, registering] [stiff, occasional, due]
I do appreciate that the numberpad and the function keys (Insert, Delete, Home, etc) are in the traditional arrangement. [do, appreciate, are] [traditional]
This Microsoft keyboard has  <i> heavy keys <i> , requiring more force per stroke than I am used to. [has, requiring, am, used] [heavy, more]
For people who have heavy keystrokes, the heavy keys might be okay. [have, be] [heavy, heavy, okay]
For someone like me who likes light keys with positive action and who likes to type with a "fluid" style of motion, this keyboard is far from ideal. [likes, likes, is] [light, positive]
I originally got this keyboard to help with my wrist problem, but because of the  <i> heavy keys <i>  I'm forced to type with harder and more deliberate action than my normal typing style. [got, help, 'm, forced] [heavy, harder, more, deliberate, normal]
I would recommend this keyboard only for those who do not mind having heavy keys (as a comparison, if you have an IBM laptop and like the firm keys, this keyboard might be for you). [recommend, do, mind, having, have, keys, be] [heavy]
If you want an "ergonomic" keyboard with split and angled key layout, check out the Logitech alternative which feature lighter keys. [want, angled, check, feature] [ergonomic, key, lighter]
The extra shortcut keys are pretty awesome. [are] [extra, awesome]
Now, granted, this keyboard does allow it, but you have to perform a two-keystroke combination. [granted, does, allow, have, perform] [two-keystroke]
My old keyboard allows me to immediately bring up the correction box with one keystroke. [allows, bring] [old]
This new unit requires either going to my mouse or performing a cumbersome two-keystroke combination. [requires, going, performing] [new, cumbersome, two-keystroke]
I have three different wireless Logitech keyboards here and they all have different placements for these keys. [have, have] [different, wireless, different]
It's very, very annoying to not be able to blindly hit these keys universally. ['s, annoying, be, hit] [able]
Well, I would not expect you would have to manually turn on the back lighting (which is not equally lit on all keys) and if you forget, the battery drains quicker. [expect, have, turn, is, lit, forget, drains] [back, quicker]
If you don't use the device for a few minutes, it goes into some sleep state and then have to press a variety of keys to wake up. [do, use, goes, have, press, wake] [few]
I have tried several of Microsoft's split keyboards and found that the space bar and some other keys did not operate smoothly on several models so I returned them. [have, tried, found, did, operate, returned] [several, other, several]
This keyboard is not only less expensive than those, but all the keys operate smoothly and with a small amount of noise. [is, operate] [expensive, small]
Besides making those keys smaller than older boards, I see no reason for them to have rearranged them, but I'm sure that in time my hands will get used to it. [making, see, have, rearranged, 'm, get, used] [smaller, older, sure]
If you rest your wrist on it such that you bend your hand up to reach the keys you may cause yourself some wrist problems. [rest, bend, reach, cause] [such]
So all in all, the keys operate nicely, it's reasonably quiet and seems that it will be around my office for quite some time. [operate, 's, seems, be] [quiet]
The extra features you get with the 4000 (like the zoom controller and soft keys) are marginal at best and don't make up for the lack of reliability. [get, are, do, make] [extra, soft, marginal, best]
I bought this to help with carpel tunnel but it has made it worse  You have to really push to use the keys and stretch like crazy if you have small hands  i have made 6 mistakes typing this. [bought, help, has, made, have, push, use, have, have, made, typing] [worse, crazy, small]
Loved that keyboard, but the keys only held up for a little over a year before getting really difficult to use. [Loved, held, getting, use] [little, difficult]
First off, I did give this some time to adapt to (around 1 week) and it is not the positioning that I have an issue with, it is the tactile  <i> feedback of the keys <i> . [did, give, adapt, is, have, is] [tactile]
I am not expecting mechanical keyboard feedback, but these keys are some of the  <i> hardest keys to press down <i>  for a membrane keyboard. [am, expecting, are, press] [mechanical]
This defeats half the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard if you have to strain constantly just to  <i> press down the keys <i> . [defeats, have, strain, press] [ergonomic]
I would rather type on a better feedback experience (mechanical classic layout) than an ergonomic with the  <i> stiffest keys  <i> of any keyboard I have ever used. [have, used] [better, mechanical, classic, ergonomic, stiffest]
The  <i> keys do not spring back <i>  very well and the net result is that typing is not as comfortable as it could be. [do, spring, is, typing, is, be] [net, comfortable]
It is really responsive( at least 15 feet away, which is all you would want to be) and the keys type just like you would text on a phone. [is, is, want, be] [responsive, least]
The main keys are fairly quiet, but the spacebar "clacks" like a gun going off in comparison. [are, going] [main, quiet]
The main keys are a bit quieter than my 10+ yr old "Microsoft Natural Keyboard" but overall that one is quieter compared to the constant "clack" (like there's ducks in my office) of the space bar. [are, is, compared, 's] [main, old, overall, constant]
I still prefer my old PS/2 white (now yellow) keyboard w/o all of the "hot keys" which is working great still but just no pretty anymore. [prefer, is, working] [old, white, yellow, hot, great]
In only about 6 months the paint on the  <i> keys are worn off badly <i> . [are] [worn]
It simply had several  <i> keys quit working <i> . [had, quit, working] [several]
The other  <i> keys feel muddy <i>  if you will, no real good feedback, and sticks a lot due to the angle your hands rest. [feel, sticks] [other, muddy, real, good, due]
Pretty good keyboard only complaints are some of the  <i> keys need a hard press <i>  to function. [are, need, function] [good, hard]
However, the keyboard feels too large, and I often find myself  <i> stretching to press the keys <i> . [feels, find, stretching, press] [large]
The keys are very quiet. [are] [quiet]
For styling reasons the bottom row of  <i> keys become progressively smaller  <i> toward the right side in order to visually align with the arrow keys and number pad. [styling, become, align] [bottom, smaller, right]
I have used mine (an older version, of course) for over ten years, despite its  <i> worthless function keys <i> , because it is the only keyboard I can find that lets me type as much as I want without causing my wrists to hurt. [have, used, is, find, lets, want, causing, hurt] [older, worthless, only]
What I simply could not accept was how  <i> sticky the keys <i>  are. [accept, was, are] [sticky]
The Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite is easy to type on - the keys feel light and you don't need to use too much pressure. [is, feel, do, need, use] [easy, light, much]
The top row of  <i> keys makes NO sense <i> . [makes] [top]
Sorry, but the keyboard is just too cramped and the unusual position of Shift and arrow  <i> keys makes me screw up  <i> pretty much every time I am trying to type a question mark. [is, makes, screw, am, trying] [Sorry, cramped, unusual]
It does not have separate 'Home', 'End', 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys that I use very frequently. [does, have, use] [separate]
I purchased this keyboard a little over 3 months ago and already the  <i> letters are coming off the keys  <i> and the spacebar sticks. [purchased, are, coming, sticks] [little]
They keys are arranged in a straight rectangle fashion, not staggered like a regular qwerty keyboard, so it's often unintuitive to type on it. [are, arranged, staggered, 's] [straight, regular, unintuitive]
Unfortunately, for about 1/4 of the keys, when you press keys, the keyboard sends two keystrokes - the key pressed and the neighbouring key. [press, sends, pressed] [key]
The keys are soft and not overly loud. [are] [soft, loud]
I took it apart to see why it stopped working and I was surprised to see that the plastic "floor" under the keys is not a single piece, but actually has lots of cracks and holes by design, and they give direct access to the electronics to anything you may throw in there by accident. [took, see, stopped, working, was, surprised, see, is, has, give, throw] [single, direct]
I was replacing a similar keyboard where the  <i> letters had worn off the keys <i> . [was, replacing, had] [similar, worn]
Withing six months an even worse problem (letters wearing off on the keys)with this keyboard! [Withing, wearing] [worse]
I was seduced by the fancy function keys, the zoom bottom, and the cushioned wrist rest. [was, seduced, cushioned] [fancy]
The rest of the keys were quiet. [were] [quiet]
Aside from that, the keyboard feels comfortable and it's correctly sized, and provides some extra keys that some might find useful (multimedia, mail, desktop, window switching and so). [feels, 's, sized, provides, find] [comfortable, extra, useful]
Also, maybe it's because I've been using laptops too long, but I really have to  <i> pound on the keys <i> , which, for me at least, kind of defeats the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard. ['s, 've, been, using, have, pound, defeats] [least, ergonomic]
As with several other people who have shared their thoughts on this product, I must say that I absolutely hate it because of the tiny arrow, page up/down, home, insert, delete, and end keys. [have, shared, say, hate, delete] [several, other, tiny]
As a HTPC remote, this keyboard surely has far too few built-in media keys. [has] [remote, few, built-in]
It only has mute, volume up and down keys at the top. [has] [mute]
I've been using PowerDVD on the PC for a long time and I'm very much used to just pressing F, B, N, P (hotkeys for forward, rewind, next chapter, previous chapter) instead of using dedicated media keys. ['ve, been, using, 'm, used, pressing, using, dedicated] [long, much, next, previous]
There are also many special functions accessible only via hotkeys, such as Blu-ray's red, blue, green, and yellow buttons. [are] [many, special, accessible, such, red, blue, green, yellow]
So I'm very comfortable being without dedicated media keys. ['m, being, dedicated] [comfortable]
It feels more cramped than a laptop keyboard, mainly due to the much smaller Enter, right Shift, Backspace, and Control keys, which are the most used (that's why they are usually made wider). [feels, Enter, are, 's, are, made] [cramped, due, much, smaller, right, used, wider]
Other often-used keys like Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn also need to be Fn-extended (meaning you need to press the green Fn key plus another key). [need, be, need, press] [Other, often-used, Fn-extended, green]
The  <i> keys are much harder to depress  <i> than most of the keyboards out there. [are, depress] [much, harder, most]
The  <i> keys are much stiffer  <i> than the generic Microsoft ergonomic Natural Keyboard elite. [are] [much, stiffer, generic, ergonomic, Natural]
Love the layout and feels better, however certain  <i> keys require a lot of force to press <i> , such as the space bar (right side requires a lot of force). [feels, require, requires] [certain, such, right]
I would have appreciated knowing that some  <i> keys get stuck  <i> as I would have purchased a different item. [have, appreciated, knowing, get, stuck, have, purchased] [different]
I like the soft feel of the keys and it's not terribly noisy, like my Dell L100. [like, 's] [soft, noisy]
But one attribute kills the potential beauty of this board, the space bar, which is one of the most used keys. [kills, is] [potential, used]
I also read that the lettering on the  <i> keys wears off  <i> after a short time. [read, lettering, wears] [short]
Keyboard feels decent, although I will say that the keys feel like they have multiple-levels and it's kind of odd to hear the space bar make 3-4 clicks for one function (this could just be exclusively my remote) The one MAJOR con I have is the fact that it's an RF device that is easily attenuated by your left hand and seemingly has line-of-sight problems. [feels, say, feel, have, 's, hear, make, be, have, is, 's, is, attenuated, left, has] [decent, odd, remote, line-of-sight]
Often if I am blocking the left corner of the remote I will cause  <i> keys to be skipped <i>  while typing. [am, blocking, left, cause, be, skipped, typing] [remote]
The  <i> keys are not responsive <i> , the mouse sensitivity is awful and the craftsmanship is shoddy at best. [are, is, is] [responsive, awful, shoddy, best]
The size of this keyboard is built more for guys who have larger hands, and I find I have to constantly move my hand around or stretch my fingers to reach all the letter keys. [is, built, have, find, have, move, stretch, reach] [larger]
Touch typists all know that the first five number keys are hit by the fingers of the left hand, and six through ten are hit by the right. [know, are, hit, are, hit] [first, left]
Trying to use this without being jolted out of what one is typing to look at the  <i> keys is virtually impossible <i>  because of that awkward split. [Trying, use, being, jolted, is, typing, look, is] [impossible, awkward]
I just can't get used to the Ergo type keyboard, used to a flat one, never seem to get my fingers on the right keys. [get, used, used, seem, get] [flat, right]
Looks like they have one light in the middle and it barely manages to light up the far away keys. [Looks, have, manages, light] [light]
As mentioned in other reviews, the  <i> keys are hard to press  <i> with the space bar being the worst. [mentioned, are, press, being] [other, hard, worst]
While the layout and features of this keyboard are great, the  <i> keys are terrible <i> . [are, are] [great, terrible]
Mine worked great for about a month, then random  <i> keys stopped working <i> , and no amount of cleaning or tinkering would bring them back. [worked, stopped, working, bring] [great, random]
Cons - Keyboard has been reduced in size so much that the PageUp, PageDown, Home and End  <i> keys require also pressing a function <i>  key at the same time which is awkward and annoying. [has, been, reduced, require, pressing, is] [same, awkward, annoying]
I would have much preferred the arrow keys placed under the touch pad buttons than in its current location. [have, preferred, placed] [much, current]
unfortunately the small right shift key and its promximity to the arrow keys produces way too many errors for touch typists. [keys, produces] [small, right, many]
To make matters worse the reduced-size cursor keys are not in the usual inverted T, but in a cruciform arrangement, which makes this keyboard pretty useless for people who engage in FPS games like Quake 2/3, Unreal etc. [make, are, makes, engage] [worse, reduced-size, usual, inverted, useless]
First, which is more minor: the F-keys (F1-F12) are super small, yet there is a TON of dead space on the keyboard that could have easily accommodated normal sized F-keys or additional media buttons (more on this later). [is, are, is, have, accommodated, sized] [minor, super, small, dead, normal, additional, later]
Second: there is little difference between the height and feeling of the "mouse" keys for left and right clicks and the height of the touchpad. [is] [little, right]
For example, most keyboards have small nubs or bevels on the "F" and "J" keys that make it easier to know where your fingers are on the keyboard without looking down. [have, make, know, are, looking] [most, small, easier]
This keyboard also doesn't have media keys other than for volume and mute. [does, have] [other, mute]
Many keyboards, including most others from Logitech, have keys for playing music and video for functions like Previous, Next, Play, Stop, etc. [including, have, playing] [Many, Previous, Next]
Even if the keyboard required something like Logitech's SetPoint software installed in order to use keys like this, that would be fine. [required, installed, use, be] [fine]
But the  <i> keys simply don't exist <i>  even though there is so much empty space on the keyboard. [do, exist, is] [much, empty]
The  <i> keys are shallow  <i> and do not provide good feedback. [are, do, provide] [shallow, good]
I often find myself fat fingering keys. [find, fingering] [fat]
What's bad about it (minor points):  - It's hard to pick up the keyboard without hitting one of those goofy programmable side keys  - I don't like those extra programmable keys. ['s, 's, pick, hitting, do, like] [bad, minor, hard, goofy, programmable, extra, programmable]
----------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT: 7/2012 The shift and spacebar keys have developed too much resistance, and it's worsening my already sore tendons. [have, developed, 's, worsening] [-----------------------------------------------------------------------, much, sore]
half the keys during the first year, making it very difficult to tell which is which. [making, tell, is] [first, difficult]
* The third one (bought perhaps 6 months ago for my office) has an entire area of the keyboard (letters y,u,h,j,k,n,m) that is only very faintly responsive, so that you have to  <i> bang those keys hard  <i> to get the letters to type. [bought, has, y, u, h, j, is, have, get] [third, entire, responsive]
After rectifying this and plugging the keyboard in, I found that both shift keys, the return and enter keys, several of the F keys and the media  <i> keys (I stopped testing at this point), did not work at all <i> . [rectifying, plugging, found, enter, stopped, testing, did, work] [several]
I tested the keyboard on several computers and stripped the keys off and replaced them with those of the first keyboard, just in case there was another problem with the keys. [tested, stripped, replaced, was] [several, first]
But my newest replacement has a  <i> mushy feel to the keys <i> --no life in them. [has] [newest, mushy]
As stated in other 1 star ratings before, various  <i> keys have stopped working <i>  on my microsoft keyboard and it's well under a year since I brought it. [stated, have, stopped, working, 's, brought] [other, various]
Some of the keys have a little  <i> too much spring in the keys <i> . [have] [little, much]
meaning that they  <i> keys can be difficult to push down <i> . [meaning, be, push] [difficult]
So  i purchased this product it works great with the keys and everything it just the touchpad it randomly wouldnt respond it was extremely irritating and i would recommend you look around for different wireless keyboards. [purchased, works, was, recommend, look] [great, wouldnt, irritating, different, wireless]
The second started sending random keystrokes to the computer after about a month. [started, sending] [second, random]
The key layout uses smaller keys than usual and takes a while to get used to. [uses, takes, get, used] [key, smaller, usual]
But the  <i> keys just don't have a nice response <i>  and feel very flimsy. [do, have, feel] [nice, flimsy]
My biggest issue with the keyboard is that the spacing of the  <i> keys is too far apart <i> . [is, is] [biggest]
Those keys are incredibly easy to press and the back of the keyboard rises slightly so you don't have to reach as far for the top rows. [are, press, rises, do, have, reach] [easy, top]
The  <i> keys are not as "soft"  <i> as my previous Microsoft Natural Elite for CTX. [are] [soft, previous]
The other  <i> keys seem pretty flimsy <i>  too. [seem] [other, flimsy]
These keyboards are destroyed the moment a few drops of liquid gets in-between the keys. [are, destroyed, gets] [few, in-between]
However, just as the previous versions of the Natural, if you plan on using many keys simultaneously, this is not your keyboard. [plan, using, is] [previous, many]
The Natural 4000 shines in that it is very comfortable as the wrist rest area has built in pads with a soft leatherette feel, the keys are quiet, and we see a return to the front riser which alleviates wrist strain due to it assisting in keeping your wrists straight. [is, has, built, are, see, alleviates, assisting, keeping] [Natural, comfortable, soft, quiet, front, due]
The Natural also gets high marks in that the keys are quiet, they are arranged in the correct standard of 104 or so key layout, so if you are a developer, you know exactly where the keys are going to be (as far as special symbols, namely the "|" key, the arrow keys, and the "Insert", "Delete", etc) are in their correct locations. [gets, are, are, arranged, are, know, are, going, be, Insert, Delete, are] [high, quiet, correct, key, special, correct]
So many of the interesting models of ergonomic keyboards re-arrange the "Insert", "Delete", "End", etc  <i> keys that it makes the keyboard awkward <i> . [re-arrange, Insert, Delete, makes] [many, interesting, ergonomic, awkward]
Another common mistake is the keyboard vendors  <i> ake the arrow keys awkward <i>  by moving the left and right arrow keys upward so that they are not aligned with the down arrow key as seen on the common standard. [is, make, keys, moving, are, aligned, seen] [common, awkward, right, down, common]
This keyboard comes with many media keys that allow you to do such things as start your music player, adjust your volume, start many popular programs including your web browser, etc. [comes, allow, do, adjust, start, including] [many, such, many, popular]
With the leatherette in the front, the soft glowing leds, and the extra meta keys, it reminds someone as if he or she has upgraded his or her keyboard to a sports car. [reminds, has, upgraded] [soft, glowing, extra]
However there is an F lock key that should be checked, and is normal, but this simply isn't the case as the  <i> keys simply do not work <i> . [is, be, checked, is, is, do, work] [normal]
While many people could argue that they do not use the function keys, in an office environment one most certainly does (how many times do you hit F3 to "look for the search result again" after searching for text in a text editor? [argue, do, use, does, do, hit, look, searching] [many, many]
The biggest issue I have is the number of keys one can press at a time before the keyboard simply can't handle any more input. [have, is, press, handle] [biggest, more]
First person shooters, one may be able to pull it off, but even the simplest games such as Continuum, or even old titles such as Interstate 76 where multiple keys will be pressed as you are holding one key down for movement, and another one for an action, it is probably headed for failure. [be, pull, be, pressed, are, holding, is, headed] [able, simplest, such, old, such, multiple]
The only final notes I can add for the Natural is noting the additional media keys, your mileage of going through a KVM to control multiple computers will vary. [add, is, noting, going, control, vary] [only, final, additional, multiple]
Many KVM vendors will tell you that if you can not control your computer past POST and before boot, it is because the  <i> keyboard has too many keys <i>  and it is affecting the KVM. [tell, control, is, has, is, affecting] [Many, many]
Also, the Natural 4000 works well with Linux (but again, not well from the Gaming perspective) as there are a few methods that can be used to allow use of the additional media keys. [are, be, used, allow] [Natural, few, additional]
It is a very nice keyboard but some of the  <i> keys dont work right <i> . [is] [nice, dont]
They  <i> keys are hard to press <i>  so my typing has slowed down quite a bit. [are, press, has, slowed] [hard]
I thought that i would miss keys because it has been years since my last microsoft natural keyboard, but i have a surprisingly low error rate - the shape is about the same as my old one I would guess. [thought, miss, has, been, have, is, guess] [last, natural, low, same, old]
so even though my hands are in a more natural position (wrist straight) my wrists hurt after typing because it's so  <i> hard to press the keys <i> . [are, hurt, typing, 's, press] [natural, hard]
LIKES: * TACTILE: I really like the tactile resistance of these keys when typing. [typing] [tactile]
Nothing irks me more than a loose-buttoned keyboard where the buttons shake and click, and this keyboard is the diametrical opposite of that - a nice firm keystrike, with good push-back. [irks, shake, click, is] [more, loose-buttoned, diametrical, nice, good]
Most of the short cut keys even function with my locked down computer at work. [function, locked] [Most, short]
Although the ergonomic style of this keyboard is nice and alleviates wrist pain by keeping hands aligned with forearms, the <i>  keys stick terribly <i>  on this keyboard and there are often several extra characters entered that I must go back and delete, slowing down productivity. [is, alleviates, keeping, aligned, stick, are, entered, go, delete, slowing] [ergonomic, nice, several, extra]
It's sooo easy to get spoiled on the convenient layout of the keys. ['s, get, spoiled] [sooo, easy, convenient]
The  <i> keys felt a bit mushy <i>  and I often would get multiple capitals when using the shift key. [felt, get, using] [mushy, multiple]
I, too, find Microsoft's re-arrangment of the Ins/Del set of keys as well as the arrow  <i> keys unfathomable <i> . [find, keys] [unfathomable]
My main and only gripe with the Dinovo was missing F1-F12 keys, and having to Fn+click for right-mouse click. [was, missing, having] [main, only, right-mouse]
I would have given it only one star but liked the other functionality of the keys and especially the raised lip on the bottom of the wrist side of the keyboard. [have, given, liked, raised] [other]
(negative angle is when the edge of the keyboard where the space bar is,is higher than the further edge of the keyboard, where the function keys are). [is, is, is, are] [negative, higher, further]
Mouse pad is in a bad location making it  <i> difficult to operate keys <i>  on the right side of the keyboard. [is, making, operate] [bad, difficult, right]
The  <i> characters rub off the keys  <i> after about three months of constant use. [rub] [constant]
The  <i> keys require too much force to depress <i> , and are too thick, which makes it difficult to type fast without creating typos. [require, depress, are, makes, creating] [much, thick, difficult]
Otherwise, it's was a functional, ergonomic keyboard, that is, until the "1", "4", and "7" number  <i> keys stopped working <i> . ['s, was, is, stopped, working] [functional, ergonomic]
Like so many others, a bunch of keys stopped working on mine. [stopped, working] [many]
With a spacebar actuator on both the left and right sides of the keyboard, this problem would disappear and the space bar would actuate like all of the other keys (which respond nicely). [left, disappear, actuate, respond] [right, other]
All but one of the keys on this keyboard are great. [are] [great]
good quality overall , but an extremely sensitive touch pad along with  <i> sticky keys <i>  that will occasionally give a long line of the same letter, or scroll uncontrollably to the top or bottom of the page prevent me from giving it a top rating. [give, prevent, giving] [good, sensitive, sticky, long, same, top]
the constant fishing around for the proper keystrokes led only by your sense of touch. [led] [constant, proper]
The  <i> keys are very small <i> . [are] [small]
The media controls: Are only accessible via function keys. [Are] [accessible]
I could find no physical or environmental reason for the  <i> keys to stop working <i> . [find, stop, working] [physical, environmental]
The key action is too stiff, the programmable  <i> keys are not really programmable <i> , and the space key sticks on occasion. [is, are] [key, stiff, programmable, programmable, key]
Could have more WMC keys. [have] [more]
The  <i> keys are now much louder <i>  and the letters have come off of half of the keys after only two weeks! [are, have, come] [much]
My last keyboard lasted me about five years and all of the keys are still readable. [lasted, are] [last, readable]
There's a nice feel to the hand placement and good action in the keys. ['s] [nice, good]
Some  <i> keys were hard to push <i> . [were, push] [hard]
It's really bulky one, and  <i> keys are not soft at all <i> . ['s, are] [bulky, soft]
I had  <i> trouble even in pressing some keys <i>  - had to return it on the same day I received the product. [had, pressing, had, return, received] [same]
I do transcription work, I haven't been able to become fully adjusted to the arrangement of the keys. [do, have, been, become, adjusted] [able]
The biggest pains are the number 6 key, and the distance between the arrow keys and the alpha keypad. [are] [biggest]
I have had 2 of these microsoft keyboards, and they all have had the same problem, the  <i> keys stop working <i> . [have, had, have, had, stop, working] [same]
My second objection is that the I don't feel the raised bumps on the F, J, and 5 keys , and I frequently find my fingers in the wrong position, typing junk, and having to go back and correct. [is, do, feel, raised, find, typing, having, go, correct] [second, wrong]
I really didn't need to, my fingers fly on the old KB, but wanted USB and wanted a bit quieter keys. [did, need, fly, wanted, wanted] [old]
), and the split in the keys is very comfortable for me. [is] [comfortable]
Now I don't need a specific "gaming KB" to play games, but I do need to be able to press more than 2 or 3 keys simultaneously. [do, need, play, do, need, be, press] [specific, able, more]
Half the time I miss it or I  <i> hit multiple keys <i> . [miss, hit] [multiple]
* On my PS2 old KB, the backslash is under the ENTER key, and I use that key for game functions (I game with mouse and arrow keys, not with WASD keys). [is, use] [old, key]
It is a decent KB, comfortable, split very well, and quiet keys. [is] [decent, comfortable, split, quiet]
It was light and typed fairly nicely, but after a few weeks <i>  keys started getting stuck <i>  or just not working at all. [was, typed, started, getting, working] [light, few, stuck]
Also, a few  <i> keys have just totally gone dead  <i> and you have to bang them down to make it work again. [have, gone, have, make, work] [few, dead]
I have never had this problem with other keyboards, even my Gyration very mini-keyboard where the  <i> keys are very small <i>  and very close. [have, had, are] [other, mini-keyboard, small]
In only about 6 months the paint on the  <i> keys are worn off badly <i> . [are] [worn]
The  <i> keys are mushy  <i> and feel cheap. [are, feel] [mushy, cheap]
Ergo: The shape of the keyboard and placement of keys (other than spacebar), is pretty darn comfortable Keyboard noise/response: Doesn't make too much noise which is good(but neither does it feel rock solid. [is, Does, make, is, does, feel] [other, darn, comfortable, much, good, solid]
Billions of useful hotkeys: You don't need all of them, but there are plenty of options, and if you start to get lazy there's a key for everything or a key you can customize to get anything done. [do, need, are, start, get, 's, customize, get, done] [useful, lazy]
-- While i don't mind this keyboard, the hard  <i> keys are frustrating <i> . [do, mind, are, frustrating] [hard]
First, I personally feel that inlaid  <i> keys are a gamers worst nightmare <i> . [feel, are] [inlaid, worst]
I can't tell you how many keys I have assigned that require me to hit something with the side of my hand or pinky finger. [tell, have, assigned, require, hit] [many, pinky]
With inlaid keys, this becomes difficult to impossible. [becomes] [inlaid, difficult, impossible]
The second problem is that this comes with a key stroke limit - after you have about 3 keys down at once, it stops reading what you are doing. [is, comes, have, stops, reading, are, doing] [second, key]
PROs + Size is excellent, smaller than a typical tv remote + Keyboard is very compact but the keys are large enough to be usable + Touchpad is a key advantage of the design and is big enough to be usable + Mouse keys and arrow bottons are well placed, below the touchpad + Range is fine (some reviewers criticized range but I had no problems, see note below on line of sight) + Battery life is good CONs -  <i> Keys are poor quality  <i> and often stick or require multiple touches to register (sometimes you press a key once and have it fill the screen with the same character, other times you have to press the same key 4 or 5 times to get anything) - Touchpad often is not responsive (when it works it's great but often it doesn't and you have to turn it off and on again) - Appears to require line of sight connection with USB receiver. [+, is, is, are, be, is, is, be, are, placed, is, criticized, had, see, is, are, stick, require, register, press, have, fill, have, press, get, is, works, 's, does, have, turn, Appears, require] [excellent, smaller, typical, remote, compact, large, enough, usable, key, big, usable, touchpad, fine, good, poor, multiple, key, same, other, same, key, responsive, great]
- Frequently have to turn on/off the keyboard to unfreeze the keys and touchpad (even in the middle of active use) - Missing F9-F12 function  <i> keys which is a problem <i>  for some applications (not a huge problem but an issue) - Have to recharge from a PC with a USB port. [have, turn, unfreeze, Missing, is, Have, recharge] [active, huge]
I didn't like the  <i> way the keys or the space bar responded <i> , all very stiff & noisy. [did, responded] [stiff]
This keyboard seems to  <i> drop keystrokes  <i> (particularly the spacebar) and there is no known workaround. [seems, drop, is] [known]
Aside from a slightly different keyboard layout which I'll have to get used to, I'm much happier with that keyboard -- no problems with the spacebar, very responsive keyboard, and no stiff keys aside from the function keys. [have, get, used, 'm] [different, much, happier, responsive, stiff]
It was hard for me to reach all the keys that required my pinkies (it actually hurt and gave me finger cramps! [was, reach, required, hurt, gave] [hard]
And the way the  <i> keys pushed felt weird <i> , like I couldn't really feel if I had struck the key, I had to look at my screen to see what I'd typed. [pushed, felt, feel, had, struck, had, look, see, typed] [weird]
the keys are soft to the touch and i didn't mind that either. [are, did, mind] [soft]
The tactile response of the  <i> keys is less crisp <i> , the texture of the keys is more grainy, and the keys do not appear to be as well attached. [is, is, do, appear, be, attached] [tactile, crisp, grainy]
I was surprised to read that so many others are having this same issue, with  <i> keys that up and stop working <i> . [was, surprised, read, are, having, stop, working] [many, same]
I've had the second one for roughly nine months and now, like other users, certain  <i> keys are unresponsive <i>  such as the 'n. ['ve, had, are] [second, other, certain, unresponsive, such]
This probably would have been fine if it wasn't for the addition of arrow keys wedged in under the Enter key. [have, been, was, wedged, Enter] [fine]
It does have a nice feeling keystroke, the range and accuracy of the wireless seems excellent, and the touchpad (the reason I bought this model vs. [does, have, seems, bought] [nice, wireless, excellent]
However the keys themselves are labeled with what appears to be just wet-transfer decals (like the ones you get in a model airplane kit) which will undoubtedly rub off with use. [are, labeled, appears, be, get, rub] [wet-transfer]
The  <i> keys have a cheap plastic feel  <i> unlike the earlier MS ergonomic keyboards. [have, feel] [cheap, earlier, ergonomic]
the lay out is just fine, but it took a few weeks to learn to hit the  <i> keys hard  <i> enough to make them work, I now find myself pounding away at my keyboard, which is working ok for me. [lay, is, took, learn, hit, make, work, find, pounding, is, working] [fine, few]
the  <i> keys are also so hard  <i> to use, I do end up making countless mistakes even after using it for over 6 months now. [are, use, do, end, making, using] [hard, countless]
its easy on your hands from a position point, but I wonder how much wear and tear I am getting from the way I have to pound these keys? [wonder, tear, am, getting, have, pound] [easy, much]
I have also worn most of the letters off the keys. [have] [worn, most]
I really liked this keyboard when I got it, despite the fact that it was missing the 'V' key and had two 'D' keys instead. [liked, got, was, missing, had] [key]
The keys have a sure over-center action. [have] [sure, over-center]
I enjoy the ergonomics of the key board, but one feature that I also love is the quite touch keys. [enjoy, love, is] [key]
Don't be gutless like me and make sure you return your keyboard if any of hte keys make clicking noises. [Do, be, make, return, make, clicking] [gutless, sure]
The slightest drop of liquid on the keys of this keyboard will completely ruin it. [ruin] [slightest]
This evening in an attempt to fix it I plug it in only to discover that more  <i> keys don't work <i> . [fix, plug, discover, do, work] [more]
These  <i> keys have funny shapes  <i> to fit with the overall shape of the keyboard. [have, fit] [funny, overall]
nice and smooth on the keys and nice looking. [looking] [nice, smooth, nice]
